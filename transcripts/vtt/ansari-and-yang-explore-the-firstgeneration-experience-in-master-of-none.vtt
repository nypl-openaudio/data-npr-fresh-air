00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is FRESH AIR I'm Terry Gross one of the best T.V. shows that premiered this

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
year according to our T.V. critic David Bianculli was master of none a comedy

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
series on Netflix co-created by Izzy's Ansari and Alan yang.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They also wrote many of the episodes. They first worked together on Parks and

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Recreation where Ansari was one of the stars and yang one of the writers.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We're going to hear the interview I recorded with them in November as we continue our series of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
some of our favorite interviews of the year.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Ansari stars and master of none as an actor trying to make it in movies and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
T.V. But in addition to all the obstacles typically faced by actors his

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
options are further limited by being Indian

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
American Many of the stories in the series revolve around issues Ansari and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
yang have faced regarding the entertainment world relationships and being first

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
generation Americans.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And series parents are from India Yanks parents are from Taiwan. Let's start

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
with a scene from an episode called Indians on

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
T.V. and Sarah's character dev is in a restaurant talking with his friend

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Ravi who's also an Indian American actor trying to find good

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
roles Devis complaining that some of the Indian characters on T.V. and in

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
movies have actually been played by white people including a character in the one nine hundred

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
eighty S. film short circuit to. Ravi who is played by Ravi Patel speaks first.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Well sometimes I can

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
tell they are white got a plane in England.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
With the rope Rover. With Johnny

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Fontane but you don't know the point which do you know you're talking about

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
do that I feel like a robot of the Indian they need.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
In the White House that Fisher Stevens make up

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
what Yeah they got a real robot a fake Union.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm sorry man I'm just. Well missions in a lot of emotions right

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
now have my favor. You know actors. It still

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
happens to the social network. That's when Jonah play is the new guy

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.000
he's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
white and brown I'm up and I read that he's won sixteen and here

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
you go back for number one sixteen something and I want to see the black They didn't let me play play.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
As he sounds scary.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Allan yang. Welcome to FRESH AIR So one of the one of

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
the plot points and one of the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
episodes is that if you're an actor if you're an Indian American actor.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
There's only one Indian American per T.V. show. There can't be two.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So you're always up against a friend of yours for the same roles

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and it's really awkward if that happens to you in real life.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
That same exact situation hasn't happened to me but I do

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
know some Indian American actors who have relayed stories

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
of auditioning for shows and basically saying well they already got

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
their Indian guy. They already filled their quota. So they're not going to cast me

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
as well and then me and Alan the writers started talking about

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
this about whether they would ever cast to like what would happen if two guys

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
were really good like if they're doing a show with three people like what would

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
they do if two of the best guys were both union guys would they cast them

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
both and that conversation where we never really figured out what the answer

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
is became the germ of the idea for the episode.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And the thing about that your character refuses to do an Indian accent

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and I mean this is true even if it's the role of a cab driver who's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
an immigrant from India. So why would

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
you like declined to do an Indian accent. Even if you're doing a character who is

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
actually recently arrived in America.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Well to be clear I don't think doing that accent is totally wrong I think that's a personal choice

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that an actor has to make whether they want to do that for me personally. Any time I've

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
been asked to do that I feel

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
like feels like it's making fun of people that have that X. and if I do it and

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
don't have that voice. It just doesn't feel right to me and it feels like you're doing it so

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
why people can laugh at Indian people. It feels kind of mean to me in some ways and it depends on the script

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
or something. It was like an intense

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
drama about an Indian cab driver and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
it's this deep passionate story and you have to do an accent OK then it's like All

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
right well I maybe would do it for that if it's something like that but if it's the guy sitting in

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
a cab and it's me saying something in X. and making a joke about curry spilling on my

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
pants. I don't see the merits and that one.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Yeah a lot of it has to do with John or a

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
because obviously there are exceptions but something

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
about accents foreign accent specifically in comedy is a little tricky

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and a lot of has to do with history because the history of Indian Asian people.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
In movies and T.V. is really fraught with difficulty and a lot of

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
these characters you see Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany's and

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
almost to a man the Asian and Indian characters throughout film history have

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
been before moons played for laughs So it's difficult and there are obviously great exceptions

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
of people doing accents and doing a great job but it's a tough personal choice.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So I want to play another clip from the episode of master of none called. Indians on T.V.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and in this scene is easier character Dev's in a restaurant with friends talking about

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
racism and comparing the kind of solidarity that African-Americans have when it comes to

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
racism and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
how people get that but that it's different if

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
you're Indian American So you're specifically here talking to your friend Denise who's

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
African-American and a lesbian.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Want to meet people get that fired up about race. Asian or Indian like you only really rich start

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
a brouhaha. If you think I'm bad about black people or gay people. I mean apology and I

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
said I don't want. Iranian

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
people don't really care. This go back to you know this can you have a problem do you know what the

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
way the policy in the back making started come true but she did have

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
to apologize right like she had to go meet with Al Sharpton. I mean that's kind of the punishment right yet to

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
find Al Sharpton and go after you with him or

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
whatever so we don't have a person like that like who are supposed to meet with Deepak Chopra.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So this gets to a larger question and your episode also raises is when you

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
call somebody out for

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
racism and. When you're going too far when do you call them out and what might

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
the consequences be if you do is that an issue that you both thought about a lot.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I think so that's a lot of what the episode is about and one thing we try to do with the

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
show in general I feel like now there is this click bait culture on the Internet

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
where everyone

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
is quick to just say something like all that person's racist or

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
nothing's racist and things about race will really spread

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
around and Al and I in the show wanted to create a

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
dialogue where it was less about this kind

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
of condemning people quickly and more about having a dialogue and a

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
conversation and hearing other perspectives and have all these different characters.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Denise black woman. Brian Asian guy. Dev Indian

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
guy talking about these issues and how they feel about it and seeing it progress

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
throughout the episode or making the show sound really funny.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It is a comedy it's really very funny I promise this is just the

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
best it is really funny and one of things I really like about the series

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
is I really like your character he's he's a decent person I mean he's

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
funny he's sometimes a little

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
selfish but he's decent he tries often to do the right thing he

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
does have empathy. It's not us. It's not. I mean there's a snarky character

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
but there's it's not a snarky show. It's not a show that's just

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
always bathing in like cynicism and. And that's and snark.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And yet it's funny that the kind of sensibility you were shooting

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
for yeah I think so we were trying to make that character very empathetic.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We also wanted to depict this character that's not just a man child per se which is a

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
character you see a lot in these kind of comedies in the film as well just. The guy's

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
not separate getting knocked up like he has his life together to a certain

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
point and he's pretty mature for the most part and to us we want to explore what happens to

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
a guy that does have his life together and is a little bit mature who's still struggling with

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
his life decisions and already has some basic stuff together.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So there's a great episode about two of the main characters in the series is he's

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
your

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
character dev and then another character named Brian

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
who's Asian American They both they both don't know a lot

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
about their parents their parents are both immigrants who came to the United States.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Brian's parents are from

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Taiwan Dev's parents are from

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
India and neither of them really know much about

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
their parents' back story but they often don't have time for their parents you know

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
like Deb's father wants to show him how to do something on his i Pad with the

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
calendar and dad just doesn't have time for that and Brian's father

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
wants him to show him something and Brian wants to get to the movie early enough so you can see the

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
trivia

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
contest

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
really important so they decided you know what. Let's let's we never get a chance to

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
say thank you to our parents for all the

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
sacrifices they've made you know to you know come to America and bring us up

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
in you know in the United States so we could have good lives so they decided to

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
take their parents out to dinner they go to an

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Asian restaurant

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and this is where the stories start coming out that. Never heard before about

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
their parents' lives are each of you first generation.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Yes. I think it's very accurate in the show are our parents are both immigrants.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Yeah those countries. Those are our real parents stories for the most part there are slight changes we

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
made but in the beginning of the episode there's a flashback of both of the

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
dads showing their journey coming from India or Taiwan to America

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and all the you know old struggles they went through and it's based on a real

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
dad that was right that episode the germ of that episode actually started when

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I remember I was sitting in a Z's hotel room. And we were trying to work on the show and I told

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
him the story about my dad which is real which is that he grew up

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
in five hundred square foot hut in Taiwan with a single

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
mother and two brothers and he didn't have enough food to the point where he

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
had to kill his pet chicken when he was eight years old or something to eat it for dinner

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and I was talking to these and said And now his son gets to sit in a hotel room with the

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
famous comedian and work on a T.V. show when it was just so staggering

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and Aziz

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
had similar stories about the sacrifices his family had made and it's just something you kind

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
of take for granted sometimes the children of immigrants and it's very legitimate all

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the emotions in that episode are very real because I felt that guilt before I think of these as

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
to so. You know for a lot of people they can visit their parents

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
like old neighborhood which might be in the same city or in another state

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
but like Alan you're never going to be able to go to like the hut that your father grew up

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
in in Taiwan I'm sure that doesn't even exist anymore but you know it's just so that

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that distance is so great it must

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
be really difficult for you to imagine what your father's life was

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
like that's absolutely true and it's funny you should say that the one time I

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
visited Taiwan I was seven years old and I actually did visit

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that really and it. Yes. It's in a town a small village called tiger

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
tail. And my dad's mom stayed there for the rest of her life and

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
it was really interesting

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
because when my dad was born he was the youngest of three sons and

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
his father passed away when he was one year old and the people in the village told his

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
mom to give him away because

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
he was just it was just too much he was a single mom with three kids and his

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
mom worked in a factory making the burlap sacks for rice.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So she wasn't exactly rolling in

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
money but she decided to keep my dad and my dad ended up being a really

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
smart hardworking kid and he would go help with a factory and it's all sort of test

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
taking based in Taiwan so he took a standardized test in high school and did really well and

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
he was able to go to a straight medical school program. So

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
he ended up being really successful he came to America moved to New York then moved to

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
California and even after all

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
that he thought about bringing his mother over to

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
America but it was just too too drastic a change so she stayed in Taiwan

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and it is a different. It is a there is a psychic goal set exists

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
between myself and my grandparents because they don't really speak English and I don't speak

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Chinese and that's my own personal shame feels I did not learn ever

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
but yeah I only saw my my paternal grandma a few times in

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
my life and that's really that's really crazy I think yeah you know all these white people visit their grandparents all

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
the time and and I think there's a bit in the show about these talking to his grandparents

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
it's the same thing with mine. If I'm talking the phone to my grandma. She doesn't speak English and I don't speak

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Chinese so I'm not sure what we're supposed to say is these what did you learn

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
about your parents from trying to get their stories out so you could put them in your series.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I basically learned the stories that ended up being in that second episode.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
My mom told

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
me it's like a it's described in the episode where she says that she got

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
here the first day but in my mom's case it was South Carolina and in the show that character is.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
New York but my mom she came to South Carolina.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
My dad picked up from the airport to group home and then my dad had to go to the hospital and

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
work and so she sitting in this apartment in South Carolina. She doesn't know anyone she's all alone.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
She's she had an arranged marriage so she'd known my dad for about a

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
week which is true it's in the absolute Well she met my dad a week later they got

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
married and then she's in

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
America and she's just there in this apartment asked her like what did you.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
What did you do that first day like Did you watch D.V.D.'s like read a book and and it's I put it in

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
the absolute because it hit you so hard you said no I just sat on the couch and

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
cried and you hear that and you're like

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
wow these people really did something pretty incredible to

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
get here and give me this spectacular life that I've been able to have and I've never really thought

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
about it I never thought about them coming to South Carolina and trying to build a life in

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
the strange place where they didn't know anybody and dealing

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
with racism and and

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
like much harder racism than like well I got to

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
do an accent in the audition like real stuff where people are just people they're pretty

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
good you know.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
So it was. It was it was a great conversation to have and

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.000
I

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
think a lot of immigrant kids probably don't have that conversation with their parents because it is kind

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
of

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
odd even if you're not immigrant to be like Mom Dad tell me your story like let's let's talk

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
about that it just feels kind of odd to bring that up and I think it's one of those things where kids like I'll

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
ask them at some point and then I bet a lot of times they don't end up doing it and they

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
never get to learn these

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
stories. As these your parents play your parents

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
in the series and why did you cast your

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
parents strikes me it's working out great in terms of my perspective is if you were

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
it strikes me. It could have the potential to be very awkward.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Well Alan and I had those characters.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
My parents. And we knew the character of my dad was going to pop up in a few episodes and he

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.000
was based

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
on my real dad the way we wrote the character and my real dad

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
is very funny and

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
silly and for me it was very important that we got these characters right because a

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
lot of times we see immigrant parents on television or film. They're

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
portrayed in this unbelievably broad fashion and they're just vehicles

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
for very

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
hacky ethnic jokes that are not real. So we wanted these characters to feel

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
three dimensional and

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
real and we auditioned a few people for these parts of my parents and when

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
they read they just didn't feel like my parents they didn't feel it felt

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
like people doing impressions of Indian people and they just didn't

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
have the

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
timing and humor that my real parents had I think my mom's funny too.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And they just didn't feel right. And those parts are really important.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
So they they both agreed to do it and it really was

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
a really strange is usually when people have their real parents do things. It's a pretty

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
quick cameo type situation or like one scene there. They were in it a lot and you know

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
they it wasn't like they came into town for a couple of days they were here for like two weeks working on the

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
show and dad took off work from being a

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
gastroenterologist to do an arc on my show. It's a pretty crazy thing you did and I really

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
have to thank them tremendously because I think their work is great and it's crazy

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
to read reviews where it's like shout at them. Sorry comes in and steals

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
the scene which.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Which is a of course not going to go to my dad at all.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
So as these your parents had an arranged marriage they knew each other week before they got

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
married

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and you do a lot of comedy about dating and romance you have a book

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
that you co-wrote with a sociologist called Modern Romance.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Must be really hard. When in your mind you compare your parents.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
With your idea of what a relationship should be.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Yes I think it's such a

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
vast difference in the way that whole process is for

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
me today than it was for my parents back then and we talk

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
about that in them so whenever I'm having a conversation my dad I think it's an episode

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
ten and I'm asking him like how many women do to me before he decided to marry

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
my mom that's the real story he told me

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
that he met two people my mom was a second person

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
and the first lady thought she was a little bit too to hold my mom.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And I was like well how and you talked about it before you decided to get married he said like thirty minutes and

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
then he was he was good and then you look at me now

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
and if we have like a lunch menu we will

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
spend thirty minutes trying to figure out what the best is yet before we pull the trigger on an order.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And then once I get them both and yeah.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
One one of the writers on Parks and Rec Harris widows died at the age of

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
thirty and. These you wrote a really nice piece

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.000
about

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
him after he died and I'm just I

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
guess I'm wondering what it's like for both of

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
you. To have a contemporary colleague who was a

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
contemporary who died. I think when someone your own age dies.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
It's just a fundamentally different experience than when somebody older

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
especially considerably older than you

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
dies. Yeah that was one of the

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
most difficult days I think of both of our lives. Hare's

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.000
was someone who

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
was. Someone we saw every day you know I

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
had what he was writing on the show when he the time he worked on Match of non And. He

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
was working on your show. Absolutely it was after it was after parks and

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
when Alan and I were coming up on the show one of the first things we said is we've got to

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
get Wiggles to be on our staff to. With us if we can get little it will be so huge because he was

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
really he's really was the strongest writer that we could think of

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
to get on board with us and we got him to work on the show with us which is so

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
flattering because he's pretty is pretty picky about what he would do and he would just kind of anything.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And yeah he was working with us every day he was in the writers' room with us and

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
he wasn't there this one day.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
He

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
was writing with this. Man it's really hard to talk about this but we're working on the

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
show and we got that phone call and I just screamed I couldn't believe it and I

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
was separate from me now and we're working separately from the other writers and I

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
told our what happened and we were just in shock and we just.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
We just walked around the neighborhood for a while I was trying to walk. Yeah we're just trying to process this and

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
then. Oh God it was a nightmare and then we had to go in

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
and it was such a weird thing where those awful websites

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
like we're just like posting about this before people he

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
knew could even find out

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
and it was one of these things are like we've got to tell them or else they're going to see it on like T M

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Z or something like that and so I went in and told

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
everyone and it was it was an unbelievably

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
difficult horrible experience and

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
it was. It was it was awful.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I'm glad that we got to spend so much time with him before he passed because we were seeing him every day

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
and I'm happy that I got to spend as much time with him as

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
I did before he left and.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
You know you see there's moments in the show that are

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
such heris moments that. I'm so glad are in there

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
and it's such it's so sad that he's not able to see what we

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
ended up doing with some of the great stuff he did.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
But it's yeah it's like Alan and I would scream when we were working on the

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
show we would screen the episodes. We'd have like a long added other episode in the

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
do screenings and we would screen stuff and Harris's stuff would get such huge laughs and we're just

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
like look at each other we're like laughing and also sad at the same time it's such a weird

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
feeling like people would be at the screening a friend would just text like oh my God like that line

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
is great like who wrote that and I feel like I was

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Harry and he was he was just a crazy comedy machine

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
and just to give an example of his personality he himself would

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
say he was the fifth or sixth funniest person in the world and we would often ask him who

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
was above him at that point in time and he would say OK well Galifianakis

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Louis and right now I think McBride and Larry David are a little funnier than I am but I'm probably

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
five or six. Yes Like it really was.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
You know there are a lot of funny people those writers rooms but what he was

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
just just so naturally talented and it was infuriating So to ask this guy would stroll

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
in and he was always the most confident dude and just be the

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
funniest as he's I'm sorry. And Allan yang. Thank you and congratulations
