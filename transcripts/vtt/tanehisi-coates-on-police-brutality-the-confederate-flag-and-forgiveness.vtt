This is FRESH AIR I'm Terry Gross. Today we're continuing our series featuring some of

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
our favorite interviews of the year and the year when so many African-American parents

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
were worried that their son would become the next Trayvon Martin or Michael

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Brown tunnel HASI coats wrote a book in the form of a letter to his teenage son.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's titled Between the world and me and it draws on history as well as

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
personal experience to discuss the different forms of violence young African-Americans

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
are especially vulnerable to from all directions on the street in school

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and from the police.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It won the National Book Award for nonfiction.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And this year Coats was the recipient of a MacArthur Genius Award cotes

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
was born in one thousand nine hundred five and grew up in West Baltimore where he

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
says everyone had lost a child somehow to the streets to jail to drugs

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to guns coats as national correspondent for The Atlantic magazine

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
last year he wanted George Polk Award for his Atlanta cover story. The case for

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
reparations about the long history of what he calls white imposed

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
black disadvantage our interview was recorded in

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
July fantasy coats Welcome back to FRESH AIR. You

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
wrote this new book in response to the recent police shootings of African-American

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
people children and adults the book is addressed to your teenage son. So when

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
you were growing up in West Baltimore. What did the police mean to you

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
when you were your son's age.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
They were another force.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So the two sided as you know it I don't want to be too cynical here. I you know I'm an American and so

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I did understand them as representing you know some aspect of

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the state that I was a part of some aspect of the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
country that I was a part of but at the same time it was definitely another part of

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
me that basically recognized them as another

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
element within the society within the community with no

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
real moral do. Different from the crews in the gangs

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and you know packs of folks who dispense violence throughout the name of the police who are not a force

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to be negotiated. That could dispense

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
violence and you know I want to be really clear about that because when you're on the outside it's very easy to you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
know label a group. You know a quote unquote gang as criminal but you know when you when you live in a neighborhood these are

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
people who you see who you talk to I mean everything does not always come the violence you can negotiate things you

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
know ways

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of you know dealing with folks and I talk about that a little bit in the book and the police

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in that respect very much the same way just like there's a you know there's certain

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
rules for how you deal with you know a certain Khuda lives in a certain place the police have certain rules for how

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
you negotiate them to if you want to avoid violence.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Did you ever see the police. Possibly protecting you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
from violent forces within your own neighborhood.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Yes I did but I also saw the crews the same way you

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
know and I saw many you know my friends who would be labeled as criminals and in the same

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
way to question you know the for me was when do you call what you know I mean so somebody

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.000
breaks into your

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
house you would call the police again I don't want to you know be overly Senekal or you would call the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
police but by the same token if you know you happen to be walking somewhere and five

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
people jumped on you and you know did some degree of violence you probably would not call police you might

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
call you know some of your cousins or you might call somebody a friend so it really depended

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
on what the case actually was.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
You had a college friend you went to Howard University. I'm

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
in imprints Carmen Jones who was shot and killed by a policeman the policeman said it was

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
in self-defense after Jones tried to run him over in his jeep and you and everyone who

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
knew Prince Jones didn't believe that story. You write about this in

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
your book tell us a little bit about him.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I went to college with printed on it's very funny because when you when you write it becomes sort of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
abstract for a while and then when people actually bought a suddenly becomes real

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
again I

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
went to college with friends. You know brass friends or great friends but he was someone who I

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
knew who spent time around who had you know just a great deal of affection

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
for Prince was tall probably about six four

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
slender beautiful beautiful man very very handsome extremely intelligent he was

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
from Texas he went to a magnet school in Texas for math and science statewide

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
magnet school as his mom explained he was the only African-American student

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
there and you know did the end of use for the book and talked to his mother Mabel Jones who lives

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
in the Philadelphia area now when I talk to what I realized was he was from a family.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Very very well to do family a

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
mother who had grown up in dirt poor poverty in opera Luce's Louisiana his folks

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
were sharecroppers who had you know basically worked a way out of poverty had become a

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
radiologist had gone to Ellis

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
you had served in the Navy and I've basically done everything America tells

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
you to do and had you know accumulated assets and some degree of

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
wealth and he was killed he was killed him he's executed like an

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
outlaw it was I was concerned the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
offices were attempting to track down someone who they had believed had stolen a gun from

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
another officer. Somehow they got it in their head that the Jeep that

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Prince was driving either belong to the guy who stole the gun or one of his

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
friends they ran the plates on the jeep the jeep came up with Prince's

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
mother's address in Prince's mother's

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
name. In Philadelphia they assume that this you know could possibly mean Adichie was stolen when in fact all it meant was

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
that his mother had bought it for him. They followed Prince Jones out from the suburbs

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
of Maryland where it went where they you know first began tracking

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
him into Washington D.C. and then out into Virginia where

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
they shot him with and you know feet of his fiance's

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
home thing about this that you know when I when I when I read it to my mind is this

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the basic you know report from the off so what was that Prince had attempted to back up his Jeep

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
several times and ram the car that the officer was driving so he. He had to kill him he had to shoot

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
him because his life was in

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
danger but I tried to imagine myself in Prince's shoes.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
If the officer who was trying and was not in a normal police cruiser The officer was not in uniform the

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
officer in fact testified that he pulled out his gun said police but did not never shoot

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
showed Prince's

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
bads the officer was dressed in an undercover disguise like he was supposed to be a drug

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
dealer and you know this is how insidious they get I have to imagine myself

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
followed from the suburbs of Maryland through D.C. out into

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Virginia realizing. At some point that I'm being followed. Not having any idea that this is a

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
cop and having somebody pull a gun out on me and knowing that I'm near my fiance's

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
house so it always seemed to me perfectly

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
logical you know that Prince perceived that he was under threat.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Was it investigated. Yes it was nothing came of it was investigated

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
by the prosecutor's office out in Fairfax Virginia I

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
believe nothing ever came of there was an internal investigation by the Prince George's

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
County Police Department. The officer was not punished there was a civil suit

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
eventually with the way the office and the police department was found liable. But when I you

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
know was checking on that the officer was not suspended he had not been punished.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
He had been previously found to have lied during another case and the lie was you know

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
so bad that the prosecutor's

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
office actually had to throw out every you know case in which this officer had

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
testified the Prince George's County Police Department was at that time under

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
federal consent decree they were being investigated The Washington Post did a series

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
of investigative Autozone on the Prince George's County Police Department around the time around two thousand and

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
one two thousand and two and found that they were more likely than any other police department in the

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
country to fired a gun

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
to the point that his mother made and I think this is actually

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
absolutely crucial crucial. According to the official record prints attempted to kill a

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
police officer. And that's how he died. So if according to the official record is actually

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
his fault. He's the. He's the one that actually instigated this that's the

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
last

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
word on his name which I just I just I mean that that is terrible it's just awful.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.000
This happened nearly fifteen years ago when it happened what impact it has on you.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I know you're at a funeral or memorial service at how I was a devastated me you

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
know lead to a totally devastated me a year later nine eleven

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
happened and I just I had no compassion. I had nine I was cold. I was actually

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
actually cold because they killed him. They killed him and no one was held accountable that they sent

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
the officer they put off so right back out on the street right back on to the force.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I couldn't believe it you know after that the conclusion I had to draw was that

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
this was a group of people you know who had been given in power by the state to use

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
lethal violence. And there was very very little chance that any of them would be punished.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And so should there be a mistake any sort of mistake with

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
me any sort of dispute in which I was killed or you know my son was

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
killed in general I could rest assured that no one would be held accountable. That's

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
very very different you know excuses people make this comparison between this and quote

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
unquote black on black violence or enable a neighbor

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
a violent would say you know if somebody in my neighborhood did some degree of violence and you know there

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
were recourse there were things that could be done and it was you know a mediation some some sort of

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
thing and sometimes you can might in fact be violent.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
But there could be no mediation between me and a state you know I mean they killed Prince and I was

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
it was it in the story

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
nothing nothing. So given your personal

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
experience and having a friend who was shot and killed by an undercover police officer

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
who never presented as

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
bad never showed his identity put that in context

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
with the more. Media covered

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
recent shootings of African-Americans by police. What does that add up to in terms

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
of the message you're trying to

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
give your teenage son now about dealing with police.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
don't know anything has changed in my mind like in terms of like how I talk to him.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
There's a lot of reporting that you know depicts is though there's a wave going on you know an uptick

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and events but I doubt it is actually an uptick more people paying attention but I've

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
been paying attention at least you know intently for the past fifteen

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
years even as I mentioned it like the media coverage because I think that's what's changed. That you know that you

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
know phones and the cell phones have led to media coverage and people are really watching

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
these

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
incidents over and over and over again and I think for people who haven't been directly

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
exposed to that kind of you know

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
police shooting Yeah you know ality it's it's

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
very educational.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It is it is and you know this thing that I had you know in my mind and I don't know that we're at this

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
point yet and you know and this is why I say I really haven't changed how I thought to myself my son.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
There's a kind of evasion going on where in

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
people think about what the police did they say was a bad cop wife we had

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
body cameras maybe we could do something about that but there's very little

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
critique about why our police operate the way we operate in the first

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
place because accuracy alternately comes back to Americans themselves we've spent the

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
past you know roughly half a century or so growing increasingly

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Draco nian stripping back you know people's rights in terms of how to deal with the criminal justice

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
system increasing the punitive nature of the criminal justice system once

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
people in the systems clutches all of that is brought to bear when

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
we think about each of these dust behind each of these is something else some sort of

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
policy some sort of decision I you know when Prince was killed. I actually did some

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
reporting around is that in P.G. County in Prince George's County because there had been so

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
many other cases like

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
that you know I don't know if I get one I want to. Folks telling

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
me that Prince George's County. You know at that time was one of the most wealthy use on class

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
for African-Americans in the country and yet the police was one. One of the most

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
brutal police departments in the country. How could that possibly be true well you know many of the

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
citizens out next county have made the same sort of calculations that white citizens around this

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
country had made that great fear was a

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
crime you know and any sort of hint. Any sort of you know inkling of a

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
crime from their perspective the police would empowered to do whatever they wanted and so ultimately for me it's a

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
question of where the citizenry is it was not just a question of what the police officers are doing you know it's a question

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
of what policies. You know we decided to pass.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
We've been talking about fear of the police and anger at the

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
police but you know part of your book is how you lived in fear when you were

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
your son's age when you were a teenager when you left the house

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
because there was a lot of violence in the neighborhood and you say basically everyone your

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
neighborhood seemed to be reacting out of fear.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
You were afraid of other kids you afraid of your father's beatings you write when I was about our age each

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
day fully one third of my brain was concerned with who I was walking to school with a precise

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
number the manner of our walk in them or of times I smiled who are what I smile

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
that who offered a pound and who did

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
not so. I guess I'm interested

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
in what were some of the behaviors you had to

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
learn to protect yourself just like walking to school walking home from

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
school going to visit a friend.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Don't walk to school by yourself.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Make sure you have at least five or six people with you is very interesting when I bask in the Philadelphia seventy

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
six Allen Iverson when he came into the league.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
There was always critique because he went everywhere with a posse and is always talk about policy while an arse.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And I immediately understood you know I did as a matter of physical safety for many years are

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
trained not to go you know into places that you don't know Bob.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Yourself getting back to those rules don't go to certain neighborhoods unless you

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
know somebody over the last you know your grandmother's D.L.'s you've got a cousin them unless you've got a really really

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
close friend there and you have a girlfriend in another neighborhood you need to go with four or five

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.000
or six other

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
people guys need to be prepared and you know you need to you know be watching

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
out when you walk through the street as my dad had my dad telling me just right now walk like you have

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
someplace to be keep aware you know keep your head on a swivel make sure you're looking you know

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
everything. Little things like understanding that I think about this all the

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
time that like the first really warm day of the spring or the summer when you're in

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
school is actually a really really dangerous day for

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
you because only a lot of kids out and people are going to you know be feeling a certain way and it's quite

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
likely that you know some amount of violence might occur and so you need to keep your eyes out on those

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
particular

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
days thinking a lot about which way you want to walk. You know it's just particular

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
to my middle school I think about this all the time you know did you want to walk down the hill should you walk up the

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
hill. So you take a long Securitas route as I would sometimes you know through the neighborhood

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
with other friends from those neighborhoods. So that you avoid certain people at certain times because they're you

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
know already home by

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
dent. There's a laundry list. You know I can remember having

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
you know like like lunchtime.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
You know you might have a problem with somebody or somebody might have a problem which is so you

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
say well I'm not going to lunch today I'm going to you know spent my lunch break in the library which is what I would do

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
sometimes because you don't want to get caught with certain folks and then is the more insidious aspect

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
of it which is this my. Disposition is not you know to the street at all you

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
know I was not anybody who knew me you know growing up with would tell you there was

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
nothing. Street about me at all but you know what are things I

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
learned within my first year in middle school because middle school when you really started indoctrinated into

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.000
this

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
stuff is that any sort of a physically you know violent

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
threat made to has to be responded to with force. You just I mean you just you can't

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
tolerate any. You know anybody you know attempting to threaten or intimidate your body

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
you must respond with

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
force this I mean this had real repercussions I mean you know I go to

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
school night great year in my high school you know and I you know I got suspended for threatening a

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
teacher. You know ask you about that because you refer to that in your in your new book and

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I don't feel like I understand why that happened. What did you say about my judgment

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
or fact.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I felt like he disrespected me you know that I mean I was I didn't

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
want. He yelled at me in front of the class by really really loudly

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
and again I mean this was the sort of thing that you. You know you can

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
tolerate you know they don't like teachers do sometimes

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I know I know but he sounds like you're laughing because like it's funny if you've never been in

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
the environment I and I thought you have a great dignity that's all that's all you have I mean you know

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
teachers yell loudly at kids from time to time you're exactly right.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
But if you live in an environment. You know if you're from a place where all you have is

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
like the basic you know sort of physical respect you will talk to me in a respectful way you don't have anything else

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
to lean

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
on that's very serious. That's really really really

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
serious you know. If somebody yelled at me now I probably would you know I you know sort of walk

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
away and live well I've accumulated certain things I have certain things I have a family you know I feel you

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
know great personal value in myself and in my work and what I what I do I

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
feel you know deeply loved by everyone around me I don't feel like I live in a particularly

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
violent environment I wouldn't perceive being yelled at you know as necessarily communicating to

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
other people around me that that they too could disrespect me at any

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
moment. So you threaten the teacher and then your rest is like

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
what I read about what did you say

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
and sometimes like you know if you say some like that to me again I'm a knock you out it was it was something but it was a

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
physical threat. Well. OK and I and in that moment I was not like it was not idle either I was very angry.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I was really angry. So who called the police

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
the teacher that he did that we had school police. We had school. OK yeah.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Yeah he called the police the teacher called the police police

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
came and I probably as I recall that I got into some sort of verbal thing with the

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
police

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
to the police handcuffed me and told me downstairs.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
They call my parents they wrote him arrested for what and everything eventually I think of

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
me released me and sent me home by myself to my

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
parents and I She says I hate saying this.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Or maybe add this is just what happened OK and I wrote the book so and I've written a book about this without That's the

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
public record they released me I went oh my dad kicked my

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
butt

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
and that was the moment you know where Like I've said this several times and he says to my mom and I

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.000
see this

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
clearly you know my mom was really you know upset and I never really been upset about you know my

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
dad dealing our physical discipline my mom would be a lot physical despite my mom because I mean you

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
know so but it really upset my mom the sight of it you know I was fourteen and you

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
know you know becoming a big kid by

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000
then and she tried to stop him and he said to her you know either I can do it or the police.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And so I go through this thing in the book about fear and what I understand

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
now and it's no make it OK and this doesn't mean it is what I would do but what

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I understand now is how deeply

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
afraid my parents were when they heard I got arrested. I remember my mom later you know at

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
all if you know blood maybe like couple hours later that same day talking to me about it just like crying.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I just breaking down and

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
crying and they are there African-American families you know around this country

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
a large large number of Africa that just operate out of complete fear the day kids

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
are going to be taken from them and will do anything you know to prevent that.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
You describe how when you were young your father beat you and sometimes he beat you for

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
getting into trouble like when you threatened your teacher after your teacher hollered at

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
you in what you saw as a very Millie ating way in front of the

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
class but your father also beat you once for not standing up to the person who

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
stole something from you and you felt like. OK he's beating me for being violent he's being you know for

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
speaking violently speaking beating me for not being violent

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
enough but you understood that he was also beating you because he said to you

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
if it's either me or the police and he was beating you in a way that he hoped would kind

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
of discipline you and protect you from getting into bigger trouble.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
So that's how you were raised. What about raising your son would you would you hit him would you

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
take off your belt and hit him with that like like you were raised.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
So in fairness to my dad I should say my mom and my dad. It was it was not the case that my mom

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
did not you know hit me either.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
I saw his father sometimes take the boy you know take all of us you don't think that is blame to be doled out.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Yeah I have hit my son before I can count. I believe when I'm

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
thinking of him now I think three

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
times I think three times in his life I mean I would never hit him what would an object I've never had

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
and what about

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
I had a pretty big hole in my house

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
about disrespect and I say had because he's so old now that we're pretty much

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
past all of us. I had a pic pretty big rule in my house about disrespect and by which I mean

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
maybe this you know. Having this conversation with you maybe this you know he's back to something really old but I

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
wanted him to talk to his mother in a certain

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
way and I wanted him to talk to me in a certain way and I wanted him to talk to adults in a certain

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
way and I wanted to communicate that to him like it was like the big

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
big thing in my house now.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
I recently had a conversation with him I was twenty four when Smart was one of my

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.000
most twenty

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
three and you know again your kids are born you have all of this great sort

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
of fear. I had him you know three three times three maybe four times

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
and his life but I told him recently that if I had to do again and if I had a kid right now I

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
would resolve not to have a kid at

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
all you know I just want to change why wouldn't you

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
know.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Because I don't be OK and I do know that when he when. I was a

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
kid and I thought you might go out and disrespect somebody and you get shot like that was what was in my head

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
you know I mean like you mouth off at a police officer and you know he get the you know the hell beat out like that was what was

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
in my head.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
You know it wasn't just I'm personally offended by how you talk now you disrespect somebody's

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
brother is dangerous out here for you it is dangerous out here for you and I have to communicate that

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
to you and I'm more confident maybe it's because I.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Well I guess there a couple things going on.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
The first thing is I've seen how my son has has has has grown you know and I've seen how maybe things

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
that when he was younger I would have thought of as oh my God I gotta get this

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
out of you because if you continue like this you know until you're twenty This could be

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
a threat to your life. I can now see them as him

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
being a child. They say oh you're your child and this is what children do.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
OK All right got

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
that the second thing is I to be quite honest with

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
you have raised my son largely around a different class of

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
people and I mean literal social class.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Who don't hit their kids by and

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
large and I do you have seen a kid to do to be honest with you all

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
sorts of things that would have you know you know just my head would explode if

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
some things. And they don't hit their kids and my initial reaction

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
is you know I'll show you know your daughter your mom and that was my mentor you crazy OK that's what your kids you know I'm here

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.000
doing X. Y. and

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Z. but I've seen those kids now like I'm old enough now she knows kids go off to college

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
get straight out you know send those kids you know basically you know grow into adults and

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
mature and I think basically the parents were right the parents understood they were children doing you know some of

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
the

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
things that children did and I think you know from an African-American perspective you know what

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
folks hearing this would say was that yes but you know a lot of those children are white and they were they are a

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
lot of children are white and have more room to

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
do X. Y. and Z.. What asked true but when you accept that you kind of

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
bring me and justice to the child you put the injustice of the world you know I mean you say what we don't have

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
much room to do X. Y. and Z.. So I'm going to do this to

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
you my impression hearing you talk right now is that

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
because you're African-American and because you grew up

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
in West Baltimore in a neighborhood that

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
was often violent that the calculations that you have to do

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
in terms of getting along in the world raising your son

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
are more complicated. Maybe I'm just stating the

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
obvious no yes no no but I think I just there summarized everything I was trying to say so yeah they're

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
just more complicated than your white

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
counterparts. They are and they definitely are they definitely are they definitely

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
are I don't really know people. Well I knew I didn't know I knew I knew one one

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
one fathered I was this way but in general I didn't really know

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
people with that exception that came

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
home like had a bad day and then beat the hell out of their kids that was

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
not like the environment I was really raised around like I said I can think of one exception to

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
that by a lot I mean this

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
was the way folks dealt with their kids the way folks discipline their kids was the way all

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
of his discipline their kids the way they had been disciplined his kids the way their parents had been

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
disciplined as

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
kids people had this conversation now about you know

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
about a spanking and about beating about you know hitting children but I you know

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
I understand it like I said I would put my hands on my kid now. Now I would do it but I just

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
think it's really important to stand where that comes

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
from. What did you have to learn about loving your son as a father that was

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
different from how you were loved.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
I had to learn not to be so I

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
thought I had to learn to not be so hard and I

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
had a wife and at that time apart know when some are I was born and for most of my

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
life a

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
partner who for whatever reason. Did not have to learn that and was very tender and

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
very very soft with him.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
And I when I saw that for whatever reason I didn't process that is oh that's his mother she's

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
being that way I mediately wondered why wasn't I way you

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
know and I lay but I you know very very I'm very very much a laborer to be that way you know

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
to be softer to be you know affectionate you know to tell him you know a

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
little things little things to tell him I love you every night and a kiss him every night before

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
he went to bed. You know my parents love me is just not something that we did it was a manifested in

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
that way I learned

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
it from from from my spouse I learned it from my

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
wife and now as you know we enter in this period oh he's going on

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
fifteen and I can see that and I you know I I'm sad

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
like you know. I'm learning that this is not going to be fab and he's going to leave me one day I'm very

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
happy I did that you know because if anything ever happens to me off a bit anything

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
ever happens to him. It cannot be said that I did not make it clear to him every

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
day how much I

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
loved him

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
I kind of had to coach thank you so much for talking with us. Thank you so much
