This is FRESH AIR I'm Terry Gross This week we're featuring some of our favorite interviews

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Up first my interview with Gloria Steinem recorded in

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
October Steinem has been a leader and symbol of the women's movement since the one nine hundred

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.000
seventy

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
S. and continues to speak out at the age of eighty

one she co-founded Ms Magazine in one thousand nine hundred two and remained one of its editors

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
for fifteen

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
years. She's written about political social and economic barriers to women's

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
rights and has also written about her own life and the personal obstacles. She's had to

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
overcome and how they represent obstacles many women face her latest

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
book My Life on the road was published in the fall.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
She estimates that she spent at least half of her time on the road for more than four

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
decades. She's traveled with a purpose to raise awareness of women's

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
issues and organize women in the U.S. and around the world as we'll hear

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
later in the interview she kind of grew up on the road.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Gloria Steinem Welcome back to FRESH

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
AIR I want you to start by reading the dedication of your new book.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This book is dedicated to Dr John Sharp of London who

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in one nine hundred fifty seven a decade before physicians in England could

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
legally perform an abortion

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
for any reason other than the health of the woman took the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
considerable risk of referring for an abortion twenty two year old American

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
on her way to

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
India knowing only that she had broken an engagement at home to seek

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
an unknown fate. He

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
said You must promise me two things first you will not tell anyone

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
my name.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Second you will do what you want to do with your life. Dear

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Dr Sharp I believe you who knew the law was unjust would not

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
mind if I say this so long after your death. I've done the best I could

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
with my life this book is for you.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Thank you for reading that dedication to your new book. When did you first speak

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
about your abortion. The

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
amazing thing was took me so long there was

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
no women's movement it was supposed to be a

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
secret women

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
didn't share in the same way. So it wasn't until many

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
years later after New York magazine had started and I had gone

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
to cover an abortion speak out held in a in a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
church downtown in New York

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
City and suddenly I heard other women standing up and talking

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
about what it was like to have to go out and seek an illegal abortion this was actually

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.000
an

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
alternate hearing to one that the New York State legislature was holding on

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the liberalization of abortion law in New York State this was before the Supreme

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Court ruling and you know a group of early feminists I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
just say said wait a minute you know in New

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
York. In the legislature they asked fourteen men and one nun to testify.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You can't make this up.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Let's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
let let's hear from women who have actually had this experience. So I sat there

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
as a reporter for New York magazine listening to women

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
tell their stories you know that were tragic

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and ludicrous and every human emotion

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
all wrapped into one and suddenly I thought wait a minute you

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
know I had an abortion and actually one in three American

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
women had needed an abortion at some time in her life so why

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.000
is

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
this illegal and why is it dangerous and it's the kind

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
of revelation that comes from people just telling the truth

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and discovering you're not

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
alone. Do you often wonder what your life would have been like had you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
not had the abortion and had you had a child at that age.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You know it just you know I don't know what would have happened I had been

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
doing all of the foolish things that we then did like riding

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
horseback throwing ourselves down stairs. You know. All kinds of things in the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
hope let it stop you right there did you throw yourself

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
downstairs Yeah I kind of I did. I did and I you know I am the most.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Cowardly person you can imagine so physically speaking but I did

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I kept thinking that

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
somehow you know I could I don't know what I thought I

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
was desperate I really was desperate because you know I just knew

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that if

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I went home and married which I would have had to do.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It would be to the wrong person it would be to a life that wasn't mine.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.000
That wasn't mine at

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
all so what surprises you about the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
current debate around abortion. I

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
think I am still most surprised by the inability

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
or the reluctance of many people to tell the truth because.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.000
You know

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
about the need for abortion and I must say about the morality of abortion because

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
it seems to me

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that every child has the right to be born loved and

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
wanted and every person has the right to control male

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and female to control their own bodies from this from the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
skin. I think we we need a legal principle called something

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
like bodily integrity which recognizes that the State

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
me. Jael us they can't insist on injections

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
or tests or pressuring us for organ transplants or. You know

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that our skin needs to. Be the the line of defense

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.000
between

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
our own dignity and will and any

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
outside force we do need a new wave of telling the truth I think however I'm

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
not surprised by the opposition

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
because it is the basis.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Of everything I mean to be able the definition of patriarchy is to be able

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.000
to

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
control reproduction and that means you have to control women's

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
bodies. You spent half of your life on the road you're still on the road a lot.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
You grew up on the road. Let's talk a little bit about your very atypical

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
childhood your mother was often incapacitated by depression

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
chemical depression.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
You know. I don't know what to call I think her spirit was broken. You know

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
she before I was born I had to give up everything she loved and

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
cared about and she was depressed she got addicted

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
to tranquilizers I just think her spirit was broken.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Your father until you were ten during the

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
summer ran a dance pavilion that he created. Would you

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
describe what your father did summers.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
This was a little like and southern Michigan called Clark

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
like he had built a kind of

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
long big pier with part of it covered part of it

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
uncovered over the lake and on weekdays there would

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
be sort of canned music and a jukebox and on

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
weekends a band then the big bands of the thirty's and forty's used

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
to travel the country in the summertime in a bus and

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
so we would get some famous band sometimes Wayne King and Jovan nobody I

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
mean names I don't know if people know anymore. And this was his dream

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and he you know he created a. Kind of magical place.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So what was it about being there were about being with your father

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
that procure Mother Spirit.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It just wasn't hers Well let me describe what she had been doing

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
before long before I was born she was a

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
pioneer newspaper reporter and journalist and actually editor

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
which was extraordinary. But it was an era in which she at first had to write under a

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
man's name in order to get published.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So you know she was a real pioneer and she loved it she adored

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
it at the same time she was married to my father a wonderful

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
kind charming utterly irresponsible man.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So there were always money troubles and you know lots of difficulties. She had my

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
sister who is nine years older than

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
me and I think you know She later explained she had fallen in love with a

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
man at work and had grown up believing that you could not divorce you

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
could not change. She had a girlfriend who wanted to come to

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
New York with her where she could try her hand at being a journalist you know she had all

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
these aspirations she just couldn't make it

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
work. She had what was then called a nervous breakdown which

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
meant she was in a senatorial for a year or two I'm not sure.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And there she got hooked on an early form of trying to realize

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
or so getting back to this life that you had as a child. Your mother

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
spirit was broken it was often hard for her to get out of bed. Your father created that

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
you know like wonderful dance to Billion summers. But then when the summer was

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
over the family would move into a van and drive

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
south and basically live when I say Van I should say trailer I suppose.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And then the family would live in the trailer for the duration until the

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
following summer you write that you never started out with enough money to complete the trip. Your

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
father would buy antiques and then sell them to antique. Dealers you know buy them at

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
country auctions and then sell them to antique dealers at higher prices to

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
fund your trip south. How did you like being itinerant like that.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I suppose the two things happened at once when you're a child one is that you just accept as

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
normal whatever's around you and the other is that you go to the movies and you

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
see kids or your classmates because I would go to school till it

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
got cold to hello in or something who are living a different way and you want to be like them you want

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
to be like the other kids.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It never for a moment occurred to me that they

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
might envy me so I both except as a and

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
hopes that my real parents would come find me and. Take me to a

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
house with a picket fence and a pony. I mean

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
that's the degree of of real ism and fantasy.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So you weren't in school for those years that your family was on the road. How did you learn to read

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and do basic

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
math. Well I'm not sure I've ever learned to do basic

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
math but but I learned to

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
read just because my family had lots and lots of

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
books especially my mother you know read all the time my memory

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
is that I

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
learned how to read from ketchup bottles and labels and billboards along the highway.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I don't know I'm not sure but I don't remember not knowing how to read.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Was it legal for you to not be in school.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
No I'm sure it was illegal and my mother always said that if the truth officer

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
showed up she would use her teaching certificate. The fact that it was for

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
university calculus which she had

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
been teaching in order to make money to finish college herself.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I don't know how impressive it would have been but anyway you know but no truant officer ever showed up.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Your parents separated when you were ten in one thousand nine hundred four and you had to take on a lot

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
of responsibility for your mother. In a drought with us some of the things you had to do for her when you were

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
still a child

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
yourself. Well it depended on you know on the ups and downs of her moods

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
but I would make her meals or the child's idea of a meal.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I kind of always worried about what I would find when I came home from school. You know because

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
she might be really depressed or she might have retreated into

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
another world

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
or she might be convinced that the war

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
was happening outside the house and

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
be wandering around in the street you know talking to other people

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
whose parents were say alcoholics and who also kind of didn't know what they

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
would find when they came home has made me realize that it's.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It's not.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I mean it's hopefully uncommon but it's certainly not unique my experience.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
She was called the crazy lady of the neighborhood once you had a neighborhood. What

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
was your reaction to that and did it make you think of her differently than you did

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
before. You know I had I don't didn't make me think of

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.000
her differently she

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
was how can I say I mean she was a

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
loving wonderful woman who

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
were cited poetry by heart and was you know certainly

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
super loving toward me but sometimes she was just in another world and I didn't

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
know when that would

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
happen. Do you remember the moment when you first

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
realized women's rights was illegitimate issue. Along with all the

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
other rights that you were interested in fighting

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
for you know the amazing thing is how long it took me.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Actually I mean there there was no. At least to me there was no

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
visible women's movement. So I thought I just had

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
to function within the system as it

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
was and I Adana fied with everybody else who

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
was. Having a hard time I think women often do

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
that without knowing that it applied to us too but

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I know it to the women who held that hearing on

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
abortion for

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
instance or you know who had been inside

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
the civil rights movement and the anti Vietnam movement and

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
even in those movements that

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
we utterly loved still were not treated

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
equally and so had understood that there needed to be and an

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
additional women's movement.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I remember you telling me that one of the reasons why you co-founded Ms Magazine was that writing

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
for other magazines they just weren't interested in women's issues they'd say Oh

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
we did an article about women's issues or about the women's liberation movement like

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
eight months ago so we don't need another article

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
yet and that article about men was like articles about the world but articles about

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
women fell into the category of like yeah we covered that a while ago. We're

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
done really well in that was true of women's magazines but

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
in other places where I was

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
writing including the Sunday New York Times you

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
know lots of other places they attitude was even worse it was sort of well if

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
we publish an article saying women are equal then in order to be objective we'll have to

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
publish

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
one saying they're not you know.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
So whatever and just for that. Well it seemed perfectly logical to them

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000
because they thought it was debatable if you see what I mean yeah I definitely it would be mean.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
But it seemed extremely frustrating and outrageous to me.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Do you remember the articles the headlines in the first edition of MS I want to

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
see if those articles could still be written today. Like how much have things changed.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Well we did have. A piece about a couple that had. A

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
marriage contract in order to make up for the unequal laws on the books

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
they had made there their own

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
contract. We had reprinted a article from

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
another feminist publication called Why I want to wife by Judy cyphers

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I remember she deserved a

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
member that I think

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
it was the woman talking about all the reasons why she needed to she needed a wife it

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
was funny

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and wonder to have somebody at home was doing the cooking and cleaning and taking care of the errands and

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
stuff which were supposed to do but she was working so she needed somebody

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
to yeah and that role would have been right lol yeah so that first edition

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
was one hundred seventy two

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
right. Yes. What's your connection to Ms magazine now.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Now it's published by the Feminist Majority Foundation in Los

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Angeles and I am an advisor to it

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
but not the daily role at all that I was

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
for you know such a very long

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
time and I'm very grateful to them that they are taking good care of it and

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
now its quarterly but it has a additional one big life on

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
the web.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
If I ask you to make a list of the five most important issues for

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
women today what would be on that

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
list. Well I can do it but I would like

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
to say that it's the most important issues are those to women who are listening.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I mean it's not about dictating to each other what's important but

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
supporting each other and.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Solving the ones that are in our daily lives. I like however you just

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
mean if you if you add up you know in terms of the numbers of

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
people I would say. That competing

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
for number one would be violence against

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
females worldwide.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
If you add up all the forms of violence whether it's domestic violence in this

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
country which is as enormously high high rate means the most

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
dangerous place for a woman in this country is that her own home and she's most likely to

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
be beaten or killed by some by a man she

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
knows or it is F.D.M. female genital

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
mutilation or it

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
is female infanticide or honor killings

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
or child

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
marriage and. Too early childbirth which is the major cause of death

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
among adolescent girls worldwide. So you know violence has reached.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
An emergency of all it's I mean any violence is an emergency but you know this guy like

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:46.000
the

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
early MC has certainly increased with groups like the Taliban and ISIS.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Generally Italian women and denying them any form of

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
rights. Yes No it's. The extreme forms

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
of patriarchy often often religious so-called

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
religious and the violence against the males in war

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
zones sexualized violence in the Congo and. You know

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
many in the former Yugoslavia. You know and all of these

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
have mounted up to a real

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
emergency but tide. I would say for first

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
place is the ability of women

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
to decide when and whether to have children because that is a major cause

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
of death the the lack of that ability is a major cause of death and it is

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
also a major cause of inability to be

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000
educated or to be free outside the home or to be healthy.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
You know so I would say those two

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
concerns violence sexualized violence against women

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
and reproductive freedom or reproductive justice

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000
are right up there in our focus in every country.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Gloria Steinem it has been great to talk with you again thank you so much. Thank you so

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
much Gloria Steinem recorded in October after the publication of her book

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
My Life on the road.
