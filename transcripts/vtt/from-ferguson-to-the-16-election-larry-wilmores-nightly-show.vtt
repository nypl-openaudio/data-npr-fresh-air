00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is FRESH AIR I'm Terry Gross.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're closing two thousand and fifteen with a series of some of our favorite interviews of the year. Up

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
first Larry Wilmore last January he started his program the nightly

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
show which is on Comedy Central right after the Daily Show. He'd formerly

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
served as the Daily Show senior black

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
correspondent the nightly show has become a great place to go for a comedic take

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
on the day's news and occasionally for some genuine outrage. Wilmore and his

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
team are especially good at addressing issues dealing with race and that's perhaps the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
most difficult subject to talk about in America.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We're going to hear the interview with Will more that was originally broadcast on August

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
nineteenth the day of the nightly show's hundredth episode we started our interview

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
with a clip of the show from the previous week when he marked the one year anniversary of the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
day eighteen year old Michael Brown was shot to death by white police

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
officer Derren Wilson in Ferguson Missouri.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This past Sunday marks one year since the shooting death of Michael Brown and subsequent president.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Ferguson The man I can't believe it's been a year already.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I mean it's crazy how time flies are in a constant panic about getting shot by the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
cops.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Larry Wilmore Welcome back to FRESH AIR and congratulations on what you've been doing on your

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
show you choked on the first edition of YOUR show that all the good bad

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
race stuff had already happened and there was like nothing left to say like you're

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
done since then I'll just Brattle off a list here.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Walter Scott was killed by a cop and Charleston South Carolina Freddy Gray died in a police van

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
a cop pulled his gun on a black teenage girl and then sat on her as she was returning from a pool party

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Texas. Bill and Ruth killed nine people at the Emanuel Ammi church in

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Charleston the Confederate flag was removed from the statehouse in South Carolina

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Sandra bland was stopped after failing to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
signal when she was changing lanes. She she died in jail. Probably a suicide.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You know. Versity Cincinnati campus policeman killed Samuel

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Dubose I know you knew that there was going to be racial stuff

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
happening but really did you expect all this to be happening

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
early on the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
show that is the saddest introduction to a comedy.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
think it's just a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
typical American sound like the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
me you know this is the stuff you have to deal with on your

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
comedy show and so now find

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
what's funny about it so that you can

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
know it's not a lot there's really not a lot.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
After the shooting at the. Emanuel Ammi church. In Charleston

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
South Carolina night nine people were killed there massacre really

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
horrible and then it's up to you to find something to say about it I want to play

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
how you handled it so here's Larry Wilmore on the nightly show.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Now I have to tell you guys when we're going to talk much about this that I mean there's a comedy

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
show all right. I mean what we've built here isn't really designed to handle this kind of

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
tragedy and let me just say I know we talk about race a lot on this show but I think we can all

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
agree this time that this is a racially motivated

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
attack. You know I think

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
it's but also

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
it couldn't be clearer when it comes out of the killers now all

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
right but even with all of that evidence and on a day like today.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Fox News just makes my head explode.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Last night deadly attack taking place in a historic church in South Carolina the gunman's horrifying

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
attack on

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
faith the question is Was it a crime out of race or

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
religion they could be calling it a hate crime because it happened in a religious institution.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So we're not safe in our own churches and where are we

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
saying there was sleeting investigated as a hate crime. There are still some pieces we have to put together.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Look at it as well it's because it was a white guy apparently and a black

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
church but you made a great point just a moment ago about the hostility

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
toward Christians so perhaps and it was a church.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
OK

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I know you guys don't want to admit that racial stuff is going racial stuff isn't

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
going on but how can there be any doubt when it came out of the gunman's mouth. Let

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
me remind you what he said I want to show you black people.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
He told his victims. I want to shoot black people I think when he

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
says black people he means black people and

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
not

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Christian Larry Wilmore on the nightly show did Fox

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
News make it easier for you to find where the joke was because they became.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
The joke in a way.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Yes in that sense. Absolutely. In part of you kind of feels a little

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
guilty for even having laughs on that day but then the other part of you feels like sometimes you need to

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
laugh just to express some kind of emotion just to be able to deal with those types of

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
of tragedies. You know they're trying to do that all the time in America but

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
there are certain types of tragedies that kind of pull it together and make us pause

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and give us a chance to reflect about where we are we're going in that sort of thing

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and it's incidents like this that I think give those that type of

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
opportunity. So you know getting laughs out of it were

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
a comedy show that's kind of our job. Unfortunately it is the biggest irony of ironies I

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
think I've ever faced in my entire career Terry I'll be honest with you that I would be mining this type

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
of territory on a daily basis and getting Lanse out of it.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So I want to give another example of how you've been dealing

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
with issues in the news so this was after

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Sandra bland was pulled over for minor traffic violation and a police

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
dash cam recall. Or did what happened you played the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
video and showed how the police officer keeps escalating things like she's in

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
a bad mood and his room being like totally compliant about it but he

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
keeps escalating things in ways you know surrendering

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
out until he finally like demands that you put out her cigarette that she gets out of the car

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
he threatens to remove her from the car and I should mention in this clip that we're going to hear

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
we're also going to hear a clip within the clip of Don Lemon on

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
C.N.N. I saw a woman who was very irritated probably having a bad day. Most likely because

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
she was pulled over

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
right. Smoking a cigarette the comedown comply with everything the officer asked

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
for then it got confusing because he told her to put out her cigarette. But

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
then offered to light her up by pointing a Taser at her head that to me a most reasonable

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
people it's very clear that this officer was wrong.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
If you have are being stopped by a police officer was that police officer is right or wrong.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Don't you do what he says until afterwards. Then you can sue him then

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
you see the law.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
OK First of all I don't know who you're yelling

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
at and secondly should one be on one's

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
best behavior when the cop pulls one over Ideally yes but most importantly the cop is a

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000
professional.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I mean should he not have been on such a power trip. OK

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
now I'm yelling Don Lemon

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
say let me come to him for the good.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I mean it's easy to say but people want you acting like the downward count is when a couple

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
you over all of a

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
sudden expectedly drunk doesn't

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
mean you like to see I'm a good my good component that

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
is put next to my stash of weed use is actually going to.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I mean yes that would make sense but on the other hand the fact. That we live in a world

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
where black people have to strategize So they're not brutalized by police is there to

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
say

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
OK that last line. That's not even a comedy line

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
that's just like I know this is insane line yet. Can you talk

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
about coming up in the writers' room with how you wanted to handle this particular

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
story right. Well that's our thesis point. That's the line that.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I'll say look here's what I feel is going on here at this moment I had

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
just really read. Malcolm Gladwell book Blink where he talks about those moments of

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
escalation that police officers can go through any he uses the incident. I think that happened I think it was

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
in Harlem. I'm not sure where he carefully plotted it's fascinating Terry of

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
how each second there was a certain type of escalation that didn't

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
necessarily need to happen. You

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
know and how much of it it is that is the officers responsibility

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
to be in control of that and that's what training is for that's why training is so important in police

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
work is

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
to make sure. Your body doesn't take over what you're

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
supposed to do because your heart starts racing and you just get into this mode a lot of this I don't even know

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
about you know it's almost like you go into dinosaur brain mode one day just takes

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
over and you just act instinctively and when you're acting instinctively in this kind

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
of primal level a lot of things happen things like when we talk about systemic by so those type of

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
things you act out in certain

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
ways and it's very worrisome to me something that we don't talk about in police

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
behavior towards certain individuals. And that's what I was thinking about

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
when we were doing that piece was Gladwell. Yeah this woman had a bit of an attitude she was

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
bit upset that day I don't know what was going on to her but I feel like it's still regardless of

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
that the police officers his responsibility not to escalate that but to escalated

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
to pointing a Taser at her and drag it out of that car was so

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
unnecessary and also the fact that as a black person in

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
America when you're pulled over by the police. You have to

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
strategize in a way so bad things don't happen to you you know it's

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
just terrible. Are you feeling that personally.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Well I have an

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
interesting relationship with this my father was in law enforcement growing up.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
He was a probation officer and I've always understood the

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
point of view of the peace officer. You know because of my dad

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and so what's interesting is that because I have that understanding I think I'm a little bit

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
harder. Because I

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
feel it's their job to be better than in that situation not to be on our

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
level you

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
know and I have buddies back in Pasadena who are on the force you know and we talk. I

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
understand how difficult their job is and the things they have to face it's very

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
difficult police. Have to have one of the most difficult jobs in society today. But at

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
the same

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
time I think a person in that position their responsibility has to

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
be high as well.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
one of your real issues is Bill Cosby you do not miss an

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
opportunity to go after

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Cosby and you exemplify that. We're going to play a piece that you did on

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the Voting Rights Act. And campaign on voting restrictions in which you still

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
manage to drive to drive to Cosby So here's

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Larry Wilmore.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Let me just remind us why we have the Voting Rights Act fifty years ago Lyndon Johnson got to say is

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
definitely one of my thoughts I'm

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Linden's past the V.R.A. which prohibited any and all

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
discriminatory voting policies so no more literacy tests no more poll

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
tax right so what's changed. Well in this case they're not so much trying to revise

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
history as they are trying to revive history.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The new rules reduced early voting to ten days from seventeen eliminated same day

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
registration ended a program to pre-register high school students and

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
band out of precinct voting.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
They're making voting.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Them Bill Cosby at a sleep clinic.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
That's right.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I mean the guy in the value of not the value of a

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
governor three more women came out against you yesterday you sick

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
bastard All right. I got a Google alert on this.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
In fact the only reason I did this whole piece. The only reason I talked about

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Gerry and Hillary and the Voting

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Rights Act. The only reason why I woke up this morning shall we put my deodorant certain type

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
been tossed when I was doing my hair the only reason the main reason I'm

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.000
here

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
tonight was so I could just tell that joke and call you out and let me just

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
say worth it.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Later Well more. So you're hardly alone in being angry at God Yeah

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
but you seem to have like a special anger and it made me wonder

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
like do you know him from T.V. circles because he's know you you know you've

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
written down that call. Wouldn't have surprised me that if you worked with cars be know

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
if you heard no worries about cars be. Yeah that I have you had you

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
heard about that in the past.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Yep you know. I think the thing that makes me the most well there

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
are certain several things about that that make me angry the period of time that

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
these things have happened over the fact

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
that these women have these allegations that people could care less

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
who cares about what women have to say you know you know the whole idea of a powerful man being

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
able to shut up all these women is so apparent to

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
me that issue was what really drove me first is the idea that a

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
powerful man can just shut women up you know that's what started this whole thing.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
It had nothing even to do with the fact of liking cars beer not liking concerts was that

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
simple issue and I don't even know how much of a feminist I was when I realized oh my God I

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
was raised by single mom.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
The six kids have three sisters. Larry you've been a feminist your whole life you really didn't

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
know it and to have been presented with these issues. It was the kind of the

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
issue that made me realize how much I really cared about women's issues

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and how much I realize it's important for me to be an advocate for issues that aren't

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
necessarily my own to be an ally for

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
issues. So if I don't do anything else. Look at the race stuff all that

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
stuff it's funny even if that went away. I think me being an ally for

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
women's issues is probably the most important thing that I that I think I'm doing on the

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
show so your show started in January and Martin Luther King

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Day And it's it's changed I think it's really a volatile I liked it a

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
lot when it started I like where you're going now describe a little bit. How you've

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
tried to

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
really you know just like toy with the format of the show as the

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
show was learning. Whereas you were learning what the show's voice was.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
For me personally as a host. Oh man Terry it was so difficult the first couple months.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I mean you're just in the middle of the storm just trying to figure out how to do the show wondering

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
if it's working if

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
it's even feel funny and and as I was doing it I got a lot of counsel from

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Jon Stewart which was great and Jon was very tough on me about the way. But tough in a good way

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
where he's tough donjon is always tough with the truth. You

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
know he gives you praise when you when you get it you know when you're there when

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
you when you're seeing it. You know he's really he has clarity is really amazing.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
It's frustrating because he's he always seems to be right his one of the most frustrating things about working and.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It's true even when you think No Just so you're wrong on this one about a week later you

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
go oh yeah he's right. How did he do.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Can you give us an example of something he said that turned out to be really good advice. Well absolutely

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
the biggest thing he said in the beginning he's he and he would almost say it with not

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
really anger but maybe frustrate. She would see. Hey man.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Stop being a host stop it you know just be yourself just be yourself out

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
there just hosting the show what does that mean whether that mean to you.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Well it took a while for me to interpret what it is when you're first

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
starting a show like that your acting everything because you're not comfortable

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
yet you know but you can't fool John he can see right through that.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So no matter how much praise I got about the showdown thing no no no no no you're you're pretending this

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
right now you're not owning it yet you've got to own it. You've got to put your opinion out there and you've

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
got to just get inside there and just be you know we had these conversations

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
several times you know and he would be more emphatic each time and it was funny because

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
sometimes he would do this this was hilarious. I would do like what I thought was a really fun show

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I thought man that was really fun you know that was funny and so I mean the Johnny goes so Mansell's the

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
house of God. How did you think last night show it and I know that's a trap. I already know

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
it's just. I go oh I thought it

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
was like Oh you

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
did you did I thought it was

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
good and then we start the conversation and I fully realize OK I get why

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
he's considering it now what I should be doing it for him it

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
didn't matter that I got last or that I got this he was always encouraging me to raise the

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
bar not just in content but in making sure that my point of

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
view was very clear and very precise and that I owned it and then I was myself so he kept pushing me

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
into that so that was the evolution of the show to be honest with you it all centered around that.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
So you were describing how Jon Stewart told you you have to develop your voice. You have

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
to have an opinion on it I want to play an example of a piece where I think he really did that

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
so this is about the Confederate flag. This is before it was officially

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.000
taken down

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
and in South Carolina so there is still the controversy about whether she should

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
be taken right on.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
So here's your take on that on the nightly show.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
OK For the record the Confederate flag is not a proud symbol of tradition or heritage it's a

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
symbol of oppression and intimidation. That's not my opinion that's an objective

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
fact on March twenty first eight hundred sixty one the vice president of the

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Confederacy Alexander H. Stephen

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
stated that the Confederate government was based on the great truth that the Negro is not equal to

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
the white

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
man that speech is now called but cornerstone speech because that

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
idea is the cornerstone of the Confederacy.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
You don't get clearer than that.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Now some people say that southern states should fly the Confederate flag because it's a symbol of their heritage but if

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
we flew every flag from our past why aren't we find a Union Jack in front of the White

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.000
House

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
and for the record South Carolina. You don't get to make the heritage argument because the

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Stars and Bars has been flying over the state house since the Civil War It went up in one nine hundred sixty

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
one to mark the centennial of the Civil

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
War and coincidentally right around when the black people

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
started with the one thing of the civil

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
rights and one nine hundred sixty one. It was a

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
reminder to black people that they should know their place. It has always been used as

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
a symbol of intimidation and terror and that's what remains today in fact

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
because displaying the swastika is illegal cross much of Europe skinheads and neo nazis

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
often adopt the Confederate flag in its place.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
It's such a racist symbol that it does double duty as the backup brace of

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
symbols for

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:43.000
the general.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
OK So older the records. I get it there are

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
plenty of honorable people have fuzzy feelings about the Confederate flag but that's irrelevant.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Where

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
the styles are will never trump the people who see it as a symbol of hate and for a state to fly this flag

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
that hey. The matches. They send to their people so for the record doesn't really have to be a

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
debate on whether or not you should take it down just take it

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
down you will get in trouble.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Due to break

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.000
down

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
no less Larry Wilmore on the nightly show well you had a point of

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
view that clearly expressed.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Yes and that and by the way John called me up on those

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
occasions it's a that's what I'm talking about if you say that after that I. Yes

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
absolutely he said that's what I'm talking about you know and

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
I was like yes I understand that you

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
know my interview with Larry Wilmore was originally broadcast on August nineteenth

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
of this year the day of the hundredth episode of his Comedy Central program the nightly

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
show.
