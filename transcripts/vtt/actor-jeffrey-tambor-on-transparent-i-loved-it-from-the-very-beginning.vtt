00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
broadcast December tenth just before season two one up on Amazon.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We started with this clip from season one's first episode. Maura is at

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
her transgender support group and is describing how she just started testing out

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
appearing in public wearing women's clothes.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
When I went to Target and I just I took

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
her you know I mean and I got into you know the checkout

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
line and the girl at the cat's Register

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
said I need to see some ID with that credit card of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
yours and you know that's fine. Right.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And I just knew I said this is going to not be good. This is going to get

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
ugly hands. So she just kept looking at me.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And then she said

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Oh I thought that you know.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And she rung up

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the batteries

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and I was of. Oh that was a big victory.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And I didn't I was trying to not cry in front of this woman you know.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Thank you for Sarah Maura thanks for being vulnerable about one more thing.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I made a commitment here last week that I was going to come out to my kids and I didn't do it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Because it just wasn't time you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
know but I will and it will be soon.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I promise you I promise.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm going

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
maybe are so selfish.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I don't know how it is I raise three people who cannot see beyond themselves.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Jeffrey Tambor welcome to FRESH AIR. How did you find the part within

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
yourself that could identify as a woman because you need to identify

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
as a woman to play this part.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Well one of the things that I I am amazed at is I thought that.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
hardest part would be the external would be the oh the nails and the hair

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and makeup and the dress and heels and the blah blah blah blah blah and

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
actually that wasn't the hardest what that was very very very easy for me and I liked

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
it I mean who doesn't like a good many pedi and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
so that came all very very easy.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
What's interesting about playing more is that I get to use more

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
of Jeffrey than I've ever used in any role and

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I think that's a remarkable part about it and truly the most

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
surprising part about doing this role.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Can you give me an example of something you have to play as Maura that you never had a

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
chance to do before or that you learn to get yourself. Well I do know I do

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
notice that. I'm playing more I am I much more and I want to be I'm sort

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
of careful of the words because they're so stereotypical but I do I do find myself

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
much more sensitive and I find myself much more vulnerable less less

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
protective and less protection or less armor.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
That's a real that's a real surprise to

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
me now your character isn't glamorous and fashionable in the way that for instance.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Laverne Cox just one of the stars of Orange Is The New Black

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
is when your character more addresses in more formal

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
attire like a long purple dress with like sequin a spangly things all

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
over it I am reminded of what my parents' generation the women of

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
my parents' generation used to wear to like weddings and bar mitzvahs.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I'm wondering when you dress in that women's formal attire. Who do you see when you look in

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
the mirror do you see people that you know relatives that you know

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
friends. No I don't I actually see as I said I do see more

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I remember when. When we were just

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
preparing and we sort of did our first sort of

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
field trip and we were going to take more out for for the first

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
time and I was going to meet more of for the first time and so we went into

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
the bathroom after a long long talk and I

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.000
was scared

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
stiff and we began the makeup and I did the hair

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and or they did the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
hair and I remember more just you know just appearing on my

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
face and that's exactly how she looks and we dressed her up. And we went

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
to we went out dancing at a place called the ox

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
wood and I remember walking through the lobby of that

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
hotel my legs were just shaking and I I said to myself never

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
never never never forget this moment because this is exactly how it

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
is to live

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
as more. And the odd thing is no one was looking at

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
me so what was it like for you to feel like you passed will

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
know if I passed.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I think I got through the night. There's people staring at

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
you not of the ox what and not at the hotel that was what was very odd.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I did

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
go on another field trip where I did have that where I went to

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
a grocery store and I was in the middle of the aisle.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Just like doing what if Mora went shopping and. I wanted to find out what morrow

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
would wear.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And what she would buy and things like that you know just not to sound too actory but that's how you research and

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that's how you find and one person did. Stare at me in

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
the aisle and had a somewhat of a sneer on their face and I also

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
said Do not forget this. This is what it looks like to get

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
clocked I don't know if they were looking at me using Well that's Jeffrey Tambor

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
or that a trans

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
woman I have no idea but I

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
do remember I remember the sneer on the face and it wasn't pretty.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Whereas in the position of having recently started appearing in public as a

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
woman in women's clothes as a woman. And

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
sometimes she kind of passes you know a notice and just blends in

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
another times

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
people stare at her with kind of you know confusion or

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
anger

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
hostility and I'm wondering like in your own life as you as

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Jeffrey Campbell or if you were ever in a similar position where people live

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
just based on how you looked that you got you know hostile or mocking

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.000
looks from

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
people I have two things I can point

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
to but what's dangerous about me pointing them out is that I could

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
never say that either one of them even equals what it is to be a.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Or of course no woman or man so whether I do know what it is to be other

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
ised in the

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
community. When I was a young boy in San Francisco. I remember

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
being sent home playing with a friend and.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I remember the mother saying tell Jeffrey to go home. And I

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
said to the girl why she

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
goes my mother says that you're the people who killed Christ and

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I got home and what was the worst part of that is when I

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
took getting is I'm

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
saying I remember when I told that dinner to my parents and I

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
remember them looking up into each other's eyes and I will never forget that.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Because it was it wasn't even fear it was like

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
there it is. So I kind of know what that

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
was and also I remember. I grew up and I

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
don't think I've ever talked about this I grew up with a list. I talk like this.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Because I had braces. And so my name is Jeff. So

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
everyone in my school called me Cliff. Unfortunately. And I say no

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
calf calf and so they called me Cliff Cliff people would make fun of me because I had this. Lisp.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
How did you lose the list was taking off the braces

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
sufficient no. I went to I went to so

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
many people and at San Francisco State College I still had

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
it and there was a man named Dr Joe MIT

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
sack who one day said Have you ever heard your lisp and I said no.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So he recorded it and he said that's you're saying.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
S.. He said this is how you say S

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
S And I went oh yes that's

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
correct and that's what it took wowed to hear. I had to hear it.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
That's a smart. Isn't that amazing yes.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So after somebody accused you of

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
killing Christ because you're Jewish and you told your parents did

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
that lead to things that they had never told you before about anti-Semitism.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Either they or

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
your grand no experience no because we were in their generation

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that where we were they were they were second generation and that was the

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
thing where everyone was trying so hard to

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
blend and so hard to fit in so nobody you know they never talked about

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
it absolutely never never talked about it you know I was bar mitzvah the

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
gunpoint by the

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
way. OK so this walks us right to a clip. I want to

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
play from the first season. So there's there's a flashback in the first

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
season where we see that.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
As you're starting to figure out that you know you really want to dress as a woman and that there are

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
other men who are that way too you find out that there's

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
this like weekend getaway this kind of camp for men who dressed as women and

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
you very much want to go problem is it coincides with the butt

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
mitzvah of your daughter.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And so. One weekend she comes to you and says this is all

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
in flashback she comes to you and says I don't want to do my butt mitzvah. I don't believe

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
in God what's the point of this. I don't want to do it and you kind of say

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
OK

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
fine and then you use that as an opportunity to counsel about mitzvah.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And then kind of sneak off to this camp where you can dress as a woman with other

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
men can Camille Yeah yeah so flashing forward to the

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
present in the final episode of the first season. Your daughter has

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
just found out the facts why you agreed to counsel her but mitzvah and on that day

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
she's left totally alone.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
You're at this. Trans at this camp. So she finds out that you really went to this camp

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and now she's going to confront you about that here goes.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So Ron tells me that you CAN SOMEONE BUT let's both say to go to dress up camp in the

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
woods that you're now. Not at all.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Oh I'm going to leave.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I'll let you cancel it.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I was

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
thirteen and the you cancelled you but there are ten year olds don't get to cancel

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
but with honey. Yeah and so if you bought me it's you know you made an agreement. I respected

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
your mind. I can't get you to do your house or what do you want me to point a gun at your head

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
so don't be so self-centered that there's another world out there. It's not involved

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
on me all right.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Allie all my

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
feeling in this room I'm not I'm the one with the phone or the I believe. Oh that's good

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
in life and what

on earth was I doing with God you know if you keep your voice to Henry and I've moved out. We

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000

You believe Chris a little bit too much. I mean even for you there's no money to go to college but don't

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000

because Vyvyan of all girl.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You cannot do everything.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
You know you have so much more to say now than when I was writing your

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
tracks giving you loans which by the way are actually loans because you

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.000
don't pay

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
back. The understand how one

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
cent. I'm paying for your

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
life.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I don't need or want or give us about your money

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.000
you

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
can scream at me any more that I'm an adult. OK So

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
there we go it settled

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
done of question. Now that you're on the payroll

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
anymore. You like me.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
If I think you. Any

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
money. But you haven't

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
talked.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
A great scene from transparent from the first season with my guest. Jeffrey Tambor

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
as

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Maura and Gaby Hofmann as his daughter.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Allie So he says to her in that

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
scene about the bottom it's the when she says What did you want me

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
to do point a gun at your head and you said that you were bar

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
mitzvah at gunpoint by gunpoint and he was being euphemistic

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
So what happened to your bum it's funny. I was bar mitzvah to Beth

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Shalom. And I had

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I had I had trouble. I didn't quite get it all part of part of

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
it was had a teacher a wonderful teacher but he could be

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.000
very strict and I

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
remember I asked him he said I said Can I ask

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
any question and he said yes and he said Take your time questions take

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
a long time. What is it. And I said how do we know there's a God and he said get

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
out to me out of Sunday

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
school. And that's an answer and I

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
had had a

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
little problem with it and also I just wasn't into

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
it anyhow I had a bar mitzvah. I learned it from Cantor Bornstein.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Actually I think I was a little dazed during it. Do you remember there used to

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
be a drug called Milltown

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
do you know but yeah it was like one of the early anti-anxiety

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
pills Yeah yeah. And so my mother. We got all the car

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
my mother

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
said my mother was really interesting and she said You notice I said yes

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I'm really nervous she

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
goes here and she gave me a mill town. You were drug

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
basically basically a drug drug that my bar mitzvah. But I gave a

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
great speech. What did you say great. I just kind of went off script and just

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
started thanking anybody. That was in the. You were feeling

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
good I was feeling good in the moment.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
You've said in other interviews that your

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
father gave you the advice don't celebrate they'll take it away from you

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and this is this is a kind of advice from you know like long periods of.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Of suffering and persecution that the Jewish people you know face

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
through through the centuries but were there times in your family where it was an

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
official celebration it was your duty to celebrate like you're not supposed to be to happy but in these days

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
it's your job to be happy.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Well my dad's thing was I mean we practically had don't celebrate printed on the napkins.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
But his big thing is I would say Dad dad dad. I mean I'm on Broadway with George C. Scott and

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
he would say Don't don't say anything. Don't tell anybody Dad Dad

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I'm getting married. Don't sit nothing nothing. Don't do anything

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
so he honestly because he was taught don't celebrate. He'll take it away from you and

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
his parents thought that and his parents and parents but because

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
if you did celebrate and you were visible. It could be very

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000
very dangerous part of it is just trauma but part of this fact.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
You were up in San Francisco your father was a flooring contractor but I think you'd been a

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
boxer before that is that right.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Yeah he was a. Light Heavyweight. Legend

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
has it legend that he sparred with Joe

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Lewis and again. Let me let me really reiterate

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
legend and his

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
mom made him give it up because she was so worried worried about it but I do remember once

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
when he was selling tile out in the front of the store. He was

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
a very big man he was about six foot

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
one and he was stooped over in this position. It was very odd it was a very

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
submissive position he was talking to this guy's short guy and I later found out that was his

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
boxing trainer. And he was assuming the position that if you do in the corner listening

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
listening to his trainer it was a very memorable thing. I also remember once

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
when I was. After he passed away and I really really loved my

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
dad I was very close to my

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
dad you know he was very very nervous about my being an

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
actor and I went to clean out his office.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
I never knew that he just never really he just worried worried worried about me being an actor he

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
didn't say much you know in other words and I went to get his trophies and the stuff out of his office and

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I open his office door and there there wasn't a single piece of wall space that did

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
not have my

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
picture or reviews on it it was on the leave a pole.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
He had saved you. But he never said anything.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
So that's great he was kind of proud and kind of bragging to himself in the space that no one would

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
see exactly which is exactly right and then exactly that way right.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
And they're exactly what that generation did he did he did see me on Broadway.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
I was with Robert Preston in sly

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
fox. And then he saw me just before he passed away in my

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
first film role with Al Pacino in and justice for all. So that's what was

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
good I later found out somebody came up to me.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And said you know your dad super death the Met and I said

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
what they said yeah your dad held a spear at the Met on

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Saturday supernumerary Another was an extra in the Metropolitan Opera.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Yeah yeah. And so I wrote this so maybe there. I think there was a grudging sort of.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
There was a lot more to be said about Barty tambour than he was letting on to.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
So one of the great roles that you played was on the Larry Sanders Show and Larry

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Sanders was played by Garry Shandling and Larry was this late

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
night Tonight Show style

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
host and you play. The

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
sidekick Hank and your catchphrase was want to do it

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
for us. Hey now you know. And so I want to play a

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
scene from The Larry Sanders Show in which Larry Sanders tells you

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
that maybe it's time to drop your catchphrase Hey now.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
So here's my guest.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Jeffrey Tambor with Garry Shandling on the Larry Sanders

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Show you know Hank this isn't easy for me but.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Would you mind not doing it on the show anymore

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
because. Frankly I don't know you really are you telling me

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
that when you you know your.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
You do

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
this that you know I'm to the same ethnic station that isn't the same as my you

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
know their you just said it again and you know I asked you not to say it.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Because they all states he doesn't even exist you say now in a sense I think.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
HE No that was real funny you know what

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Hank. It's not even in the dictionary Hey OK this is this is no use

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
we know in the second circuit you say. And of course my sidekick

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
a and of course my psych you can't know. And that's a sentence.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
There's a scene in The Larry Sanders Show with Garry Shandling and my guest Jeffrey Tambor or.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Everything when I watched Garry Shandling I said whatever he's doing is what I believe

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
in that's what I believe comedy

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
is it's not Pat It's not automatic It's not

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
super performed. It's sort of messy and very very

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
funny and he goes past the laugh to get something else.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
So this final question. This might

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
be heading into territory I kind of want to. I want to kind of want to talk to you for the rest of my

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
life so sweet I would enjoy it if you so you

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
know you've been sober for I don't know more than a decade. I don't know how. The

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
years exactly fifteen one of it's liberating to

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
be sober in the sense that you know an actor has to be kind of naked in a lot of ways like you're

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
inhabiting somebody else but you have to feel free to go to

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
uncomfortable places and everything and to not be to be open to feeling

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
things and if you have a secret like if you've been secretly drinking or something that

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
that has to kind of close you off in some way.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
So I would assume so I'm wondering if it's easier

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
to be open in a way that you must as

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
an actor when you're sober. Well even though people think

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
it's all or freeing to you know to

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
be. Actually I can only speak for me in my life

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
I find that in sobriety. I feel much more.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
And I have much more depth. I also feel not to segue. But as being a parent.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Of five kids. I can bring much more to my acting

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
and so I'm all about anything they give you more feeling and more depth.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
You also feel more and in feeling

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
more there are there there. The waters can get rough but

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
so what let the waters be rough. I don't think if I had

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
if I hadn't been so bright don't think I would have even been around for

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
transparent All right thank you for that yeah I

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
think your resources are feeling your

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
resources are Depp's your resources are

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
learning your resources are touching and feeling and

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
to me sobriety helps and AIDS all

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
