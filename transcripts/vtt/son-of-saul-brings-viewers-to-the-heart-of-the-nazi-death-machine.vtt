00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is FRESH AIR I'm Dave Davies filling in for Terry

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Gross son of Saul the hunger Aryan film set in the Nazi

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
concentration camp Auschwitz Birkenau won the grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It opens in New York and Los Angeles today. Terry interviewed the director and star

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of the film. Earlier this year.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let me say right at the start here. I usually try to avoid Holocaust

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
movies I've read books about the Holocaust I've seen feature films and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
documentaries and at this point I don't want to go to a theater to watch

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
such unbearable suffering. Unless it adds to my understanding of the Holocaust or is

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
an exceptionally well made

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
film but I went to see the new film Son of Saul and it is an

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
exceptionally well made film and it left me with a better understanding of how Auschwitz

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Birkenau operated as an extermination

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
factory and of the Jews who the Nazis forced to be the workers in that

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
factory Jews who were called Sonderkommando as their job was getting fellow

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Jews into the gas

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
chamber the corpses into the ovens and then disposing of the ashes. I have

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
two guests to talk about making the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
film gazer Roehrig stars as Saul a slender Garion

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Jew who is a Sonderkommando in

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Auschwitz Roehrig was born in one thousand nine hundred seven grew up in Budapest

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and has lived in New York for the past fifteen years he had a few small acting roles years

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
ago but he's mostly a poet and fiction writer and is a graduate of the Jewish

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Theological Seminary in New

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
York. Laszlo Nema she directed and co-wrote son of Saul he was born

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in Budapest Hungary in one thousand nine hundred seven moved to France as a child and has

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
returned to Hungary son of Solace his first feature film.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
That's on Amish gazer Arik welcome to FRESH AIR. The opening

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
scene of son of Saul is very chaotic and we don't really know

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
what's happening at first but we soon. Find out what's happening is

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that the whole transport of Jews has just arrived at Auschwitz.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
They've been taken off. I guess it's a train and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
they're there in the camp and there's just chaos you hear like screaming and crying

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and German commands and they're basically being told to go into this room take off their

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
clothes hang up their clothes on the hooks and go into this

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
large group shower so that they can get clean because there's hot soup waiting

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for them in the soup is going to get cold unless they hurry

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
up and also that they're going to have good work to do because like the Germans need good

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
workers and there's interesting jobs to like hurry up and get your shower so we

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
can get moving and of course the showers the gas chamber and it's

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
a really chaotic and also horrifying scene and you see how they really don't

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
know or they don't know for sure what they're in store for and we

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
also see the zonder commandos including you know the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
main character Saul who gave the plays you know kind

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
of hurting them in and getting their clothes hung up and everything.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Can you talk a little bit. Laszlo about starting the film with that and the kind. The sense of kind

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
of chaos that you wanted to create and the lack of understanding the lack

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
of total comprehension and in the Jews who have just been taken to Auschwitz.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
wanted to convey something of the fact that the camp was a mixture of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
chaos an organization something that you could really see in movies

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
because movies. Usually they talk about how well organized

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the camps were but actually the camps were

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
chaotic where makes YOUR of languages

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and noise and and diff and death would

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
be around about you as a prisoner you wouldn't know when you

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
would be

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
dead or when you would be alive.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Yeah and this is something. The lack of predictability. That's in

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the in the experience of the prisoner just something that has never

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
been you know communicated.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So we want to do to merge the viewer a new experience of the of the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.000
main character.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
The film was shown through the eyes of a Sonderkommando would you describe who

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the Sonderkommando is

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
were and the work that they were forced to do.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So there's on their. COME ON THOSE were a group of prisoners who were

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
actually separated from the rest of the other

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
prisoners male prisoners who were forced to assist the Nazis in

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
the extermination process. These were the prisoners who had to company

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the deported people to the gas chamber and then take out

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
their corpses and and burn the corpses in the audience of the crematorium.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And then scattered ashes.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So these were the people who were the heart of the extermination machine.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.000
They

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
were in exchange better fed and better clothes

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
but they knew that they would be liquidated in a few

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
months and they actually made notes of

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
secretly of their everyday lives and. In their experience

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and and their rebellion also the dipper trying to plan and carry

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
out this act this rebellion actually took place

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
in October ninth and forty four which is the only armed rebellion the history

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.000
of of

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Auschwitz and your film is in part about that

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
rebellion that the film has

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
in its core also a rebellion that that is being carried out. Whereas.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The main character is trying

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to bury his this boy who who he thinks is

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
his is his.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So much of the. It was about the industry of death the work of getting the people into the ovens shoveling

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
out their ashes dumping the ashes in the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
river and I know some of the source material comes from journals that

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
the zonder commandos kept and buried in the hopes that someone in the future

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
would find them and some of these journals were found years later.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I'd like you to each talk about the experience of reading

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
those and to describe a passage or two that stands out in your mind that helped inform.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Lazlo the writing and directing of the movie or gays to your performance in the

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
film. I came upon these right things in France

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and then years ago it was an incredible experience

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
reading those manuscripts this so-called scrolls of

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Auschwitz. I was transported in to develop present of

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
these men who witnessed the extermination

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
firsthand these tanks were put into

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the ground before the rebellion of the zone the commandos

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
for example they

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
on the revenue called Judge Diane

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
who was a member of theirs and their commando his name was labor long force who

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
was opposed to a member of his and their commando

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
he had a very factual description of their everyday

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
lives and and. And day by day all the

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
new transports that would

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
come one day. A group of three hundred

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Jack young boys arrived to the crematorium. And

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
they're still full of life and full of some kind of

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
hope and but they had the same time and they they feel

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that this is the end and he just he just describes

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
how you know every step of how they had to dress and go to the gas

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
chamber and his owner kimonos going to talk to them. Because it's

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
absolutely forbidden to talk to the to the New Year transports so

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
it's the stakes are really at the heart of the extermination machine

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and for that reason helps me.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
In fact finding ways to tell the story from

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
within the camp and not some kind of story that that belongs to the

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
post-war period of the retrospective

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
story. And gave the how did Reid reading these

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
testimonies affect your performance these are like first person

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
testimony right well there was about the

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
hundred was all that on the members who were actually survived the

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Holocaust who were liberated and I think it's important to point out

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
that this one they're going to members in that terrible rap.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Differed despised by the other

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
prisoners and not only by the other prisoners were so much so they had a terrible

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
rabbit when the Soviets came to Auschwitz they were asking

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
around you know the Jews who was on their commando member and they shot

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
the person right there.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And the Soviets argued that your version than the Nazis because you're killing your own.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Brothers and Sisters. So the reason why

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
there are so few accounts from actual

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Sonex surviving zone they're going to members is

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
because they've are very hesitant to even to their own

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
family families you know in what capacity. Were they the

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
camps so I relied on the have heavily on

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
these scrolls of Auschwitz and also a book and four hundred pages

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
book called That would be wept of the doubt two years which is a

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
for their own good I was at the audition the story in from the

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
zero and he in the course of like twelve two years.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Conducted this. Painstakingly detailed into it he was he was on there comando

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
members eight of them there's about twenty alive now. About

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
the you know their daily routine these twelve hour shifts the night.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
What were you doing exactly one of them I think feeling.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Miller check. Do you mean accuracy survive five lucubrations.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
He says that there was this consensual rule among

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
them that even though they were

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
schlepping their bodies on the floor when it came to a child

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
they carried the child to the ovens in their laps. So

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that was speaking to me as a father

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
for you mention how hated the zonder commandos were and

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
how this Soviets would even execute them and I found out

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
who had been a sounder commando because they had collaborated with the Nazis and as you put

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
it helped kill their own.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
How did you both deal with the moral question that you're making a film about

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
these people who are forced to participate in the extermination of

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
their own people.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Now if they didn't do it they would be killed but you could you could argue better to be

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
killed than to kill your soul. While killing others

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
like that so you know I'd love to hear what you

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
both the process you've gone through of thinking that through.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I in full agreement with dreamily. I think that the most

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
the

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
monic crime of the Nazis was exactly

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that forcing informing compiling

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
these special squads on the disk. You know threat of

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
death to assist in the killing process and

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
by doing so they deprived even from

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
the solace of being

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
innocent. To make out of the

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
able

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
to shift the burden of guilt on to the victims

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and so the seas I think that this is the most fun forgivable the same is

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
true by the V.A. one hundred the Nazis used then forced the

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
leaders of the Jewish consuls all over in Europe to provide them

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
lists the sort of things like

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
that is basically making. The Jews partners in

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
their crime. You know. Trading them

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
down to the rock bottom of their mortality and succeeding in that.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
So I think we have to suspend judgment. I have up most of the

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
suspect for this on their commando members who did commit suicide

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and that were not to be linked to you know participate you know

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
this but I would never be so

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
arrogant for women aren't armchair twenty

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
fifteen to label and blame

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
these on their condo my members who had families on the other

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
side of the wall in the camp and they did their best to survive.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
When they did commit suicide those who did what did

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
they do the risk. They were sneaking into the gas

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
chambers and actually. One of them wrote that he

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
was order the. In the chamber. And there was a women

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
from his village and the minister on and him and pushed him out saying V have to die you

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
don't and you know this is this is just not right. Just

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
just bleed just just go on because you don't know what tomorrow

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
brings you have to bring the message to the future. That's

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
it that's the idea.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So the question is whether there's

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
hope that can still exist in the middle in the midst of outer.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Loss of humanity and and death.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Terry. Yes. You know I share your story real briefly that I think those more than anything

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
about being is on their commander member. Yes please. OK so I

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
do not know any of them in person but I do know one of their son.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So there is this man invest just

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
or David whose father was in Auschwitz but that all

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
he knew that his father was in Auschwitz his father did not like to talk about

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
it and he's laid these years about to pass and he

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
gave his wheel in an envelope to his son David

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and after the funeral in the presence of the family's lawyer

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
they opened the envelope and they learned that

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
his Father's

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Will is to be cremated

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and not only that but he wants. He's ashes to be carried back to

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Auschwitz and placed in the oven and that was a. Obviously

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
a shock they did not doubt that his father was on their Come on that number.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
He mentioned that in the will that he had been an

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
omission having the will correct.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And so basically by asking.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
David to carry his back to Auschwitz I think he would he

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
was making a couple of points One

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
is that this is the people to whom I belong to even more than to

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
my family. That's the community I belong to so

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
that what

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I was eating came and that's what it must have been like to to to

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
be he's on there comando member and

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
for you know using and years out to do this task beach

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
by the way just to be a little bit more like factual and descriptive the way that happened is that there

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
was an initial selection who goes to the gas and who goes to the bottom. And there was

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
a

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
secondary selection when the Nazis came into the Barak and

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
they lined up the people making the males and the pig the one that the

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
strongest stocky and they did not tell them of course what's the nature of the job they just

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
said you're going to get good food you can have a different

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
life. You know join us and so in beat by they learn the in the

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
following days what was this all about this a complete shock. You

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
know so. So these people. I mean on the left the strongest of the strongest the Saints

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
or the you know was

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
but humanly speaking I don't think these people had really a choice to

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000
make you know it was it was just they were thrown into the situation.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
It was a life and death matter and they just wanted to make sure that they think the next breath not

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.000
from the

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
gas. One of the central perhaps the

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
central story line in a movie has to do with gays or the character that

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
you play the Sonderkommando that you play finding a boy who survived the

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
gas chamber who barely survived he's choking he can barely

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
breathe and your character would like to save him.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
But what actually happens is I won't go into detail I'll save some of the stories

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
for people to find out for themselves in the movie but he dies pretty

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
quickly and so GAZEY your character wants to at least try to

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
save this boy's soul least that's how I interpret it and

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
so he wants to find a rabbi to say cause for this boy he doesn't want the boy in

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
the ovens he doesn't want the boy autopsied by you know the Nazi

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
doctors and then his mission becomes to find a

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
rabbi to get somebody to say the prayer for the dead cottage and to give this boy

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
a burial and he's doing it at the expense of doing some things

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
he's supposed to be doing to prepare for the

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
rebellion but he he feel. He can't say the living but perhaps he

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
can save the soul of this one dead boy

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and I want to know what you were thinking as the person playing this

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
character when I

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
think you know I think he's that the happiest person in the movie. I

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
think that I'm talking about from that moment onwards when he you know sees and

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.000
meets the

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
boy I think that. Their

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
resistance is taking place on two different levels in the movie. One is and it's

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
obviously completely legitimate is

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
a political biological way of resisting and just to get the hell out

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
of here and that's fine and it's important. He

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
I think is resisting on the one lever higher than that and I think

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
that he's doing something for someone

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
else. You know they were it's he's not concerned with the

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
survival of his physicalities survival is his life he somehow

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
goes through an experience by seeing these boys each is obviously a mirror image actually assigned even though

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
it's historically the quarter they did

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
happen that people survived the gas chambers.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
But but

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
still he took that as a sign and

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
brought him back to normalcy and there's a very few things that are for sure to have

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.000
a

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
life but I think every day to lead young earth with their glee. That you

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
know feeding the hungry or courting the poor birding that that is just. Just

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
the most human thing you can do and it's about excellence

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
human thing. I mean animals do not bury you know they leave their fellows

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
to

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
decompose the Dewberry and he just

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.000
by

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
ignoring the rules of the place an obviously

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
this is completely prohibit the through like slapping around dead bodies and bury

00:19:59.000 --> 00:19:59.000
them there.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
He does the see God's the seed creation the context and he does the right thing and

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
that gives same purpose.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
I want to quote something that you said Laszlo about why a cascade in

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
the leading role. You said he's at once old and young handsome and

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000
ugly ordinary and remarkable deep and impassive quick witted and slow.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Is that what was your reaction to that.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.000
I agreed

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
half perfect.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
This film was on your face the whole time. So last well why did you want to shoot it that way

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
so that we're almost

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
always seeing gazes face and sometimes the actions happening in back of him and sometimes it's

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
happening in front of him but we're almost always seeing

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
him. We wanted to do a portrait

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
of a man inside a concentration camp and not sure more and tell

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
more and describe the entire camp we wanted to really take

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
the measure of one man because seeing one person gives

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
the

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
measure of and of reference so that the viewer can

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
really feel not see but feel something of the enormity of

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
the horrors of the Concentration

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Camp good so how did you prepare for having the camera on your face for so long I

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
mean actors tried not to telegraph emotions through using a lot of

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
facial expressions your character is trying to

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
keep his own soul alive by saving the soul of someone else

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
but he feels that they're all dead anyways that their death is just inevitable

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
and that they've already been killed in some ways even though they're still alive.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
How do you get that to register on your face without

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
overly demonstrating what you're

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
feeling. I was of many to think a whole lot.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
How on earth. Were these people are able to do this you

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
know just how what what's how deep you go

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
down to become like a zombie in the you have to really turn

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
off your humanity your empathy

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
and just have that

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
look pilot flame you know that's

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
pork because that's was exactly the intention.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
I think that on the one hand the so-called dollar cost was a very

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
barbaric and yet it was very sophisticated if you think

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
about the psychologically especially the in order to destroy God's image and I say it's

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
not enough to transform man into the walking

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
corpse in order to the story God's image in us. You

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
have to do. He's humanity and humanity I think

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
is located in a lot of real good as a stable and that's exactly what they

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
targeted

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
install and once he became this

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
robotic monster who is just doesn't see what that front of him and he

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
doesn't hear what you know right around the surroundings he's just

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
going on a V. TES duty. How how do you

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
right through that state

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
of mind. I was thinking of that they're reading. Running. They're

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
reading eating during sleeping.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And I don't know there's no formula or something I can fix you know Sherry

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
and you like

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
how but one thing I can tell you is that I did

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
my best to stay in nineteen forty four I was not socializing

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
having coffees with people at

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Drake's trying to really focus and I think if if it verdict.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
It's really due to last will and the team. I mean the or working

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
on the same movie.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Laszlo you cast gays in the leading role and he had to be good

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
in this sort of. Film to work

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
and fortunately he's quite quite good but he doesn't have a lot

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
of acting experience. Why in the world would you cast

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
someone worked out for the best but why in the world would you cast somebody who didn't

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
have much

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
experience when so much in hands on their ability to be

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
able to hold the camera.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
You know from the outside it seems a little reckless to you know for a first

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
project first film making a film on the

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Holocaust having. You know an actor who is.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
You know hasn't acted for years and you know being just

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
a first timer is you know supposed to so many so

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
many problems

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
and and and traps along the way especially with this kind

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
of risky strategy that we do we had to

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
portray the main

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
character. So I think there were a lot of things that were a little bit you

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
know crazy. I guess we were a little bit unconscious of the dangers but at the same time

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
we were very conscious of the you know the more reality that we

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
were you know dealing with and we try to

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
respect you know the subject and the

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
dead you know that we were talking about and also the

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
living and and

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
and and I think that I needed someone for disbarred

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
who was already so the main character

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
he I needed someone

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
who when the you know did edition start doesn't have to

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
perform and when just it should start doesn't have to you know you

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
know and to do something very

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
specific but actually has in himself already a lot of

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
things that the main character

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
has. Granted

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000
this subject matter did not start with the movie.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
I was forty six when I was playing this role and I felt even just by

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
a leading the script that felt like my whole

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
life to be honest. Was like just one big breath

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Gratian for the

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
soul and what I mean by that is you know I

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
think I have some idea of what a father he's losing my own father at four and then I

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
went to war

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
so and learned Polish and leave the in Poland and when I

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
was there I was nineteen at the time saw the camp Auschwitz

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
near Cracow was still under the care of the

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Soviets and I wended in that the Simberg day. And what it meant to

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
be just the one the news it ended up to be like a month and I

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
actually ran to the room. You know Shan shame which is the current name of I

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
should think

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Polish and I went there every single day from the opening to the evening. I told

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
my first point in book. Single only about sheets.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
And and so you know and then I got to be a father.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Thank God for four due to four

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
children and of course my grandfather who was liberated from

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
the press to get the SO I felt like a lot of aspects of my personal story came into

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
fruition in this

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
or less well how was your family affected by the

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Holocaust. Well I think I don't have real family because

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
of the Holocaust. I have a very small

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
family and

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
actually there's a sort of shadow family. It's you know

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
stuck in nineteen forty four and the shadow family is haunting

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
us you know or accompanies us. I can feel the

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
presence of it all and I think I'm from a job. Rationed

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
that didn't have a do really direct

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
access to this period but at the same time things were stories were

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
transmitted and my mother had the time you know when I was

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
really little a Qur'an five or six. Told me about how

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
their grandparents were deported and killed. You know she adds and told me about

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
all the stories that she she has

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
heard sure. So actually I think nobody really spared

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
me in this process and I was I was very

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
aware of the destruction that we are carrying it on ourselves.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Especially in Jews from Eastern Europe really have this feeling. I think of

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
this destruction to still present Very much

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
so whether many Jews left in Hungary when you were growing up.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
You know medically I mean this is the largest Jewish community on the map between the French and the Russian

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
I'm liking of our SO THE END UP THERE is about one hundred thousand Jews in

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000
their video simulate the Phantom I just just like about the nomadic bliss.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
So yes that's a logical mind.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
You know the same thing I think it's a very low key presence. I think and also

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
because of of pressure from society to remain low key and

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
low profile.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
How frightening was it to hear stories about extermination and the extermination of your

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
own family when you you will see when you were fine I mean so many

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
people adults don't want to expose their children to like a violent

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
movie but then other children girl up in actual violence and there's no protecting them.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Your parents shared with you the truth about the

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
violence that had preceded you and that had taken so many lives

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
including lives of your family.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Yeah I think it was very very frightening but at the same time

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
I preferred to you know. And then to be spared

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
and not protected because I think or

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
I wouldn't have been prepared for this

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
world with without

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
knowing because also this you know in this world is very much affected

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
by what happened during the Second World War in this world still not to

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
have has not come to terms and Europe has not come to terms and the Hungary isn't going to

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
do so I think it's.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000
It was a brain for process but at the same time this.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Well

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
I can say that that that made the region really attractive to me because

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
I just heat and heated all these and these sort of built out

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Italian system and so what I was persecuted by the comedy it's that was just

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
very attractive to

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
me and later on of course I later

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
and sadly that large section of

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
the religious establishment daring to call me somebody informers and they call a call operate

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
to desist the and so it wasn't enough to be a police to be

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
like necessarily in the opposition of the as you

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
seem but I do remember that and. Kind of

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
by inclination I'm some of the pew least. And that's that's why this whole charge

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
of collaboration of what is on there call on the

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
limbers I found it in a very personal way because in high

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
school you know growing up you know one party system. You know you had

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
to make choices and every choice that you made in this regard had really

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.000
important

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
consequences in terms of being accepted and you know was it a part of disease so I

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
ended up being

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Boland for universities because I was into the link to become a member of the

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
youth communist party which was basically practically obligates

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Syrian me my whole haikus high school class one day joined

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
a party and ice. You know their

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.000
words. Yes I think it is the Verde.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Q.T.S. thorough enough events that the Jews basically ended up from want but

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
that Italian system Nazi Germany or the Nazis or playing Hungary

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
and basically were thrown into that the

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
other. And so for a while embracing Judaism and

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
racing religion was a way of defining define communism. But you know

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
all religions have their own no authority authority structure too. Did

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
you belt rebel against that structure the time.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
That's why that's why I do then I don't think I was pretty close on the track to become a rabbi and that's why

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
I decided not to because I write oh yeah I felt that the individual

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
autonomy overrides any sort of group membership and

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
I feel that didn't feel like I I would

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
be able honestly to represent any sort of institution

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
I just I did that and that I couldn't.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
So or movement.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Yeah yeah. So do you feel like you've left

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
the Holocaust Now do you feel like you can you

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
can. Stop obsessing about it now that the film is over

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
because it's a very

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
bleak place to to have lived for so long while you were making the

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
movie and I'm not trying to compare your suffering making the movie to people

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
who actually were in the camp suffered. You know I understand there's a difference but you

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
voluntarily immersed

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
yourself in this for a long time and now outside of doing interviews

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:48.000
about it you're on you're on the other end like you've come out of that tunnel so.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Are you feeling a sense of relief and with what's next for each of you.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Well

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
I thought why I'm making the film that I would understand more.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
By the Holocaust slaves think I did maybe I listed more factually but I

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
didn't ever really

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
understood but it's still I think part of me and it's all almost

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
a jennet genetic thing you know you cannot get rid of your genes.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:25.000
I guess disease are that it does. The Holocaust is now in our genes.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.000
I

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
don't think I plan to leave that topic behind and it's not because

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
I'm upset is the No way like it would be

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
caught fairly like a political got for me that I know I'm for life

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
and and and and and but. But at

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.000
the same

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.000
time I mean you know one third of the jury was.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Purdy's murder and pretty soon after one of every three come bodie

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
and was murdered and then be that into dog food Rwanda and Isis and just look

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
around I again

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
this is this this this sad sad ass. It's

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
a pattern that is going on and I'm not what what I'm obsessed

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
vid is not the whole the

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
cost per se is is that the naked shameless cool

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
T. that again many faceted in nineteen forty four five

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
The is just feeling among us I then that's what bothers

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
me the most and the you know governments they call them these kind of actions but

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.000
so

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
what they still take place as the speak and so did it really

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
became part of the legacy of modernity and and

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
and the ever verdant the old told Terry that the you know

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
this kind of barbarism belongs to the past you know that the hordes of

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Genghis Khan and all that

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
and and it it eclipsed by the rationality of the

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Enlightenment and. And that's what I grew up made and

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
and once it kind of hits me in the face. I would

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
not let myself to pass and close the book on the

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Holocaust because I

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
think it's rude to be scape is and I think I think to

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
keep my sense of reality really and

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
clear and in the valley that I just can't can't

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
overlook it.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
I want to thank you both so much for talking with us and thank you for making this movie. Thank

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
you thanks for having

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
us gaze a reg stars in Son of salt. Laszlo

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Nimish directed and co-wrote the film. It opens in New York in Los Angeles

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
today.
