This is FRESH AIR I'm Terry Gross the song. Uptown funk by Mark Ronson was

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
one of the biggest hits of the year. Today we hear from Ronson as we continue our series

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
of some of our favorite interviews of the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
year. Later we'll feature my interview with Izzy's Ansari and Alan Yang

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
co-creators of the Netflix comedy series master of none.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Uptown funk is featured on Mark Ronson album uptown special but the lead vocal

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
is by Bruno Mars. Who co-wrote the song Roth and his musician

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
producer and D.J. he's put out four albums under his own name and they all feature

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.000
other

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
artists singing the songs he co-wrote and produced.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Bronson's production work on the Amy Winehouse album Back To

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Black helped to make international hits out of her songs rehab and you know

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm no good. Mark Ronson grew up in the music world His stepfather is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Mick Jones the co-founder of the band Foreigner. He was born in London but his family

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
moved to New York when he was eight. He's now a much sought after

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
producer and is done recordings with Adele Paul McCartney Ghostface Killah and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Duran

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Duran I spoke with Ronson in April just after uptown funk ended

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
its fourteen week run at the top of the Billboard Hot one

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
hundred doing.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Much

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
like this but I'm

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
afraid that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It was

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
pretty clear from the Spider

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Man it's writing about him

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
as. You

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
know that and break

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
it down to see how little you care to see how little

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.000
don't

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
even know

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
who to believe

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but just

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:40.000
want

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000
just

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
wait a minute. That's Bruno Mars uptown funk produced by my guest Mark Ronson

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Mark Ronson welcome to FRESH AIR. What a great track.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Thank you you said that that started as a jam but it's so heavy with hooks and it's

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
so kind of produced and filled with references to other recordings so it seems so not like a jam.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
yeah where it came from an initial burst of it did come out of

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
a jam a bluenose studio you know he's playing

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
drums and Jeff Bhasker co-produced the wreck with us and since I

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
was playing bass and I think that that spirit or at least the rock of most of maybe

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that is in there and then yeah like along the way you fine tune it because you're thinking like OK we need to know

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
turns into a song and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
then also when you're doing something that doesn't sound like anything else on the radio at the time

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
you almost need to like I include it to make sure it gets or you know you have to put these hooks in it

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
you know you got to make sure you got all that candy in it to get through the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
gate. What does it mean to be a producer. I think a lot of people don't really

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
know what does it mean for you to be a preemie like your real hands

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
on producer So what does it mean when you're producing so. Thanks.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I think you know for me whatever I need to slot

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
into to make that music. The best it can be or help the artists who

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
have I'm working with achieve whatever vision they have in their head for a song so sometimes if

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I'm

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
working with a rapper like those Face Killer onas producing usually means in

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
hip hop that you make the music you make

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the beat and you give it to them and they write the rhymes. Then you know the other more traditional role of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the producer and like the kind of Quincy Jones sense is kind of part arranger if

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
you're coming up with these you hear these songs are quite bare bones and you dream out well what's

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the band doing what's the rhythm section doing what's the guitar strings

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
pianos that sort of thing. It's almost like a little tool box you just pick up a little bit of

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
whatever the ones you think are appropriate and you try and you know combine them and then you bring in other people

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
that are great for the things you're not so good at

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
so when I was working with Amy Winehouse on back to black you know she had all these

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
beautiful songs credibly well written and just her on the acoustic

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
nylon string guitar and she played them for me and then I would kind of drum up my idea

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
of what I thought make a demo is what I thought the jump should be doing the guitar is

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
like quite a crude dam and then I play it for her

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and she liked it would run with it and then eventually got it that kings into

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
record and that was

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that. We mentioned Amy Winehouse. So let's talk about

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
the huge hit album that you had with her back to black. I know

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
you produced most but not all the tracks on that album you produced you know I'm no

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
good right.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Yeah good let's hear that one and I'm choosing that because it's a great recording and also

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
horns stand out so well on it and that what's all your doing getting the death Kings

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to perform with her. So why don't we hear that and then we'll talk about

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
it so this is the late in the White House the song is you know I'm no good and

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that's from her album Back To Black which was largely produced by. Mike asked Mark

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Ronson

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
get

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
out

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
why one area

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
where

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
our bank

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
where out

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
out

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
why and what

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
our hair

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
out out out out

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
out

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:07.000
out

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000
there

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
saying with the late Amy Winehouse her song you know I'm no

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
good at

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
track was produced by my guest Mark Ronson who produced most of that

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
album Back To Black which was a huge a huge hit.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So the way you were describing it it sounds like she played you maybe a demo of

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
the song. What did you hear in your mind and how did

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
you put that together for what became the final

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
recording on this song was really one of the best examples of one of the songs that

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
the debt. Kings you know musicians who play on this stuff really brought to life because of

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the chords in the way me had played the song I had always thought of it almost as like a

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
kind of Latin like samba What is it. It was

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
originally.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And that's how I had the demo and I kind of got in and I just told the band I was like here's

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
my range man I'm not really feeling it so why don't you guys just

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
like hit on a groove of how you would play this chord chart and Homer

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and the German the bass player from the DAT King one of the most incredible rhythm

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
section probably the most incredible written section I've ever worked with just came out with

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and it just instantly changed the song and then Dave

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
guy and Neil came up with that horn line

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and that was when I really discovered the magic of the debt kings

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and how you know very much like the Wrecking Crew in L.A. And you know the

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Funk Brothers like our special group of musicians that really just bring you something that nobody

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
else does.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I think the baritone saxophone works so well because Amy Winehouse has such a deep

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
voice and to have an instrument that's going to be way beneath her. It

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
just even adds more deepness yeah to

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.000
the

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
recording I you know that was the first time that I probably ever used

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
a baritone sax and it's certainly the texture that you know it's all over the record

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
because it's a nice complement to her

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
tone. So how did you first heard the dead kings. You must've heard them before deciding

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
to bring them on for this album.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Yeah I had started to use Dave guy the trumpet player

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the credible musician. He came into the studio one day

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and they just cut a cover of science will deliver something with Sharon

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Jones and I was blown away by how they got that sonic I

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
mean it was just so much the real deal and had the time Amy and I

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
was working on demos for Back to Black and I was probably using you know like

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
whatever computer trick i could they have plugins you know for your computer that make

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
things sound old whatever it is and.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I played Amy this recording of Sharon Jones and I said like how good it is we should

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
get these guys to play these damages. Yeah she would say it's

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the not if she thought something was really good it was the

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
not that she said it was the knots and we got the whole band not just the horn section.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
So how did you get to work with Amy Winehouse How did you did you approach you. We matched up

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
with someone else.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Basically there's a good friend of mine who was hit. Yeah

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
my publishing publishing

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
company he had asked me was like you know do you know this guy. Amy Winehouse she's in New

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
York for a day she's kind of meeting people to maybe what was on the second album and I remember

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
about three years before that first regular come out and

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I just remember really liking this one song off that cold in my bed and being a little

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
bit and now I was this you know this young kind of Jewish girl from North London you know the

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
same thing from a Jewish family from North London this incredible voice and so I said yeah I'll meet her

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and you know to be honest I wasn't I got

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
some big shot I got that point you know I was meeting with anybody that might want to work on music you

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
know because you never know where chemistry is going to come your break or whatever it is so she came to

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
my studio one day

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and I was on my sis treat my son canal and downtown New York and we hung

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
out talked about music you know she was so magnetic

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and. I guess our energy I just instantly like Sarah and I wanted

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to impress her basically like I wanted to have a piece of music that would make

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
her feel like wow I want to work with this guy you know for lack of

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
better words and so I said why don't

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
you go home back to the hotel and I work on something tonight and see you

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
know come back tomorrow and play your little piece of music and see if you're into it so she would

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
play me all this stuff in the Shangri-La Zidan of the sixty's girl group that she

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
was into and I was kind of inspired

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and she came back and I had the next more. I mean the

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
piano chords for Back to Black and the kind of the skeleton beat with the tambourine and

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I just put a bunch of cheap reverb on it because I thought like that's what that sound supposed to be like

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and she really dug it and that's how we ended up. She ended up staying in New York

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
another week so we you know the rest of the songs that she

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
had. What I had for

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
her for you for you and she had the hit of rehab knowing that she really did

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
have drug and alcohol problems that that rehab really was an issue in

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
her life.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I guess because at the point that I met her shoes pretty much so you know

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
the most together. She had been maybe like in years so it

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
was strange that everyone was telling me these stories like you know you I can today you know I have good

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
luck like I said she's been working on this record for three years about.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And I just had no idea what I was talking about because she came into new you know she had these

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
songs she seemed to be creatively on fire she

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
wrote back to black in rehab while we were there in the studio and you know kind of a matter of

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
hours and. So yeah so she was good so when she was telling

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
me this story about rehab. We're actually walking down the street

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and she's saying you know those time a couple years ago I was in this

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
dark place and my family came over and some friends and they tried to make me go to rehab and

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I was like no no no and she put up my hand and I just thought

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
like that's such a catchy kind of turn of phrase and it

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
would you know should we go back and just maybe do you want to try to write a song with that because it just

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
instantly sounded like a hook to me. So it's very much sounded like something

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
that happened in her life and she kind of moved past so there was never any kind of weird

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
like yes if she was

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
like if she had terrible problems and was drinking every day in Syria there's no way I

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
would have said like oh that's a great idea for a song but because it felt like something that she kind of

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
you know

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
just overcome. Didn't seem that

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
INS in like a bad idea.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
When we hear a little bit of that Mrs Amy Winehouse and the track is rehab. It's produced by my

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.000
guest Mark

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Ronson Taco Bell goes out rehab. They

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
go

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
away

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
the

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
money I

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:41.000
made

00:14:41.000 --> 00:15:10.000
with

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:19.000
the

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
album So Mark

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
you come from a a really musical family your stepfather is Mick

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Jones who was who is the guitarist in the band Foreigner and wrote one of their biggest hits

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I want to know what love is so let's just hear a few seconds of that song to refresh

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
people's

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
memory banks

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
gone

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.000
back

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
to

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
the top again.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
That's foreigner a song written by my guest Mark Ronson stepfather Mick

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Jones So how old were you when that song was

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
released I think that was about maybe ten years old you know that.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
He met my mom when I was about seven and then we moved to New York. We live in London at

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
the time she got married to him and then he wrote that song for

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
her so it's kind of amazing I mean my wife is always like I

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
don't write lyrics so I couldn't really technically write a song for anyone I could write a very

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
nice instrumental so she always gives me a hard time because it's just such a

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
ridiculously impossible standard to live up to that your stepdad wrote that song for your mom

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.000
but

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
yeah you can understand how in comprehensible it is to me to have parents

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
where your stepfather wrote a song for your mother

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
that becomes this

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
like huge international hit. I can't grasp what that would be like.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Did you like the track when you were ten.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Yeah I think I did I loved it then I think I love it now you know I

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
really love something about being around the recording studios you know like

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.000
those days and

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
eighty's they would be like in the studio to a four five six in the morning walk on the songs

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and sometimes I'd be allowed to be hanging out in the studio which I just love kind of like being in the room

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
with these big recording Das was all these like buttons and knobs and watching the

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
guys use them or

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
sometimes he'd come home you know I was getting up to go first to school in

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.000
the

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
morning he'd be coming home at the same time and I'd he'd play me like the most recent mix

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
of the song from the studio and asked for my input and I don't remember when it happened but he would

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
always tell me that I'd be like you know my little English schoolboy voice like well I remember that the

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
bass was turned up slightly more on the mic from last week and I thought that was good old whatever.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Like there was some little things in there. He said that he came to like really enjoy my opinion

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
or at least like my little comments on the song so I was kind of destined to probably be

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
a studio rat.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
What has been the impact for you on your life and your career of having a really

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
big hit again. Uptown

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
funk. You know it's weird it's it hasn't really

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
changed my life in any kind of way that I

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
can measure I mean it's it's obviously

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
such insane the amazing thing you know none of my

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
other records I've ever had before

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
even approaching to the top one hundred you know like there's songs like Valerie and bang bang bang

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
that I was so proud of and you know the level of success that they had if they were little cult

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
hits meant that you know I could sell out Webster Hall or Williamsburg musical or that our race here in

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
L.A. like that was having made it to me so does thought of having a number one song and my own

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
career like never

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
even registered and the music is kind of

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
a it's like a finicky industry to be in of course like tastes change

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
your one minute you know you know I've been through it quite a few times like on both sides of

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
it and I guess the best thing about having a successful record like

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
this is like I know I'm at least another five years before everyone to

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
like you know the haters start to come out again and that's really what it's like every time you have

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
one of these years sort of year leases renewed another five years and that's

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
kind of great for me because it's all I really want to be doing so at this point is

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
making records and getting to work with artists I think are

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
exciting. Well Mark Ronson it's been great to talk with you thank you so much and congratulations.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Thank you for having me thank

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
you my interview with Mark Ronson was recorded in April his single uptown

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
funk featuring Bruno Mars was one of this year's biggest hits.
