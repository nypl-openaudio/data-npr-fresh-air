00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is FRESH AIR I'm Terry Gross. My guest Adam McKay is best known for

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
writing and directing the comedies Anchorman and Talladega Nights.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
He's a former Saturday Night Live head writer and co-founded the comedy Web site

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Funny or Die. He wrote and directed the new film The Big Short based on

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Michael Lewis's nonfiction bestseller about the collapse of the housing and credit

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
bubble in two thousand and eight which led to the collapse of the global

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
economy the film's main characters played by Steve Carrell Ryan Gosling

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and Christian Bale predict the collapse realizing what most Wall Street players

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and top American financial leaders have failed to either see or

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
acknowledge that the bubble is based on bad loans for mortgages that the homeowners

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
will never be able to pay off. Here's a clip featuring Christian Bale as Michael Bari

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a hedge fund founder and manager who's convinced that the securities of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
bundled mortgages are going to lose their value. So he shorts them he bets against

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
them. The people invested in this fund already thought he was odd listening to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
speed metal wearing T. shirts to the office and going

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
barefoot in this scene two of the investors in his hedge fund come to his office to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
tell him his strategy is crazy.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I want. We have no confidence in your ability to identify

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
macro economic trends.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I flew here to tell me how why every and any one can see that there is a real

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
estate problem.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Actually no one can see a bubble. That's what makes it a bubble. That's dumb

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
always Marjorie's mortgage fraud quintupled since two thousand

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
average take home pay is flat but home prices are soaring That means the homes

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
are debt not

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
ask Mike burry a guy who gets his haircut at Supercuts and doesn't

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
wear shoes knows more than Alan Greenspan and

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Hank Paulson talked to my priest as he

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
does. OK Adam McKay Welcome back to FRESH AIR

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I have to tell you if you had come to me in there's no reason why you would have done that but if

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
you come to me and said. Should I make this movie trying to explain the economic collapse of two

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
thousand and eight and trying to and trying to explain all the financial instruments that caused

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
it like.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
C.D.O. was. Which stands for I never remember what it stands

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
for collateral to realize that at obligation Yeah if you came to me and said Should I make

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
a movie like that. I'd say no don't do it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
because I try so

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
hard in like two thousand and eight and two thousand and nine to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
like having interviews that explain what was going on and we had on great explainers and they

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
would do a great job and it was still always confusing because this stuff is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
just intended to be confusing. I

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
think so why did you think you could actually make sense of it and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
make it an entertaining comedy even.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Well you know the book I was lucky in the sense that we had a fantastic book

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
by Michael Lewis and what he did was he did a very smart thing

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
he linked these amazing characters these real people that saw

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the collapse coming before anyone

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
else with the vital information of the collapse. So their

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
emotional arcs are tied to this information. So I was done with the book I had

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
a pretty good view of what happened it wasn't totally

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
comprehensive but most importantly I was very emotionally engaged in these

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
characters story and the world to how deep he goes in the Wall Street. I'd

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
never you know had that feeling of being so intimate with that world. So

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I knew right away the fact that they were so attached to the information in the characters that

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
you could do

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
it and then the next step I did was I just asked a lot of questions of a lot

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
of experts and read a lot of

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
books and my father. Annele kind of analysis was it's really not that

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
hard and that there's a lot of effort made on the part of the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
big banks and the ratings agencies and in some of the financial

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
media to make it so complicated that people can't really

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
react to it but when I got to the essence of what really happened it really wasn't that tricky.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So had you lost money in the two thousand and eight down

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
or known a lot of people who did.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I did lose money I mean my story is hardly worth bringing out the violin

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.000
for

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
because you know we were fairly well diversified and protected but I had a close

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
family member who lost their home. I had lots of friends who lost their jobs.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It was more of a rippling kind of thing and then even with the Web site run with Will Ferrell Funny

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
or Die we had to

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
downsize we noticed movie studios in town started making fewer movies

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that put people out of work. So the effects were you know far reaching.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And then I just found it really interesting that before I read this book and started doing research I

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
really didn't fully know what it caused it I knew there was a housing bubble I knew there was

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
some negligence and that's all I really knew

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and I just thought that was crazy that we have this twenty four hour a day

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
news machine churning in this country and that somehow I didn't know the mechanics of

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.000
how this would

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
happen. So I have to ask had you invested a lot in the market would you

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
think of yourself as an investor and had you ever shorted anything because the whole concept of shorting

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
is essential to understanding how this whole game was played.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I have not shorted anything to this day although we keep joking now the people that work on the

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
movie whenever we go to like a restaurant and we get bad service we go we got to short this

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
place. But shorting it no I you know one of

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the worst things you can do is to know a little bit about something and think you know a

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
lot so I am a lucky and I have to have a really good. Financial Advisor and I

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
still play it very conservatively. I've almost shorted a couple companies

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
but thank God I didn't one of them I was like I'm going to short them and then since I had that

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
thought they've gone up twenty percent

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
so don't listen to me for stock advice.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So if you had to make like a one or two minute pitch about what this movie is

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
about how would you describe it.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I would say it's about a group of outsiders and

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
weirdos and but at the same time brilliant people that saw

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
what no one else could see billions of people did not see which was that the world economy was going

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
to collapse and the question is why did they see it when no one else saw

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
it and how would you explain how that Milton was connected to the housing

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
bubble. I actually practiced this online oh that

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
family I practice with my wife and then eventually it got down to my ten year

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
old daughter Pearl from the

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
landlord and I got a really good friends

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
are funny and sketch the landlord. Yeah.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Exactly exactly and at first she was like that stop this is boring and then eventually it's like

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Oh I think I see what you mean. So all it is is that at one point

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
in the late seventies a guy thought hey mortgages are boring. You don't really make a lot of money off

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.000
of them

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
but if you package thousands of them together and bundle them into one

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
bond a mortgage bar

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and you can then sell them and with those returns you can make a lot more money

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and because there are so many mortgages in it it's

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
safe. So they started doing this and they started making billions and billions of

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
dollars and banking started growing it grew four times the size it was in the seventy's

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
to where it is now.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
But what happened was they ran out of good mortgages to put in these bonds because there's only so many people that can buy

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
homes so they started filling them with crappy mortgages they call them subprime when they're

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
really risky. So all the sudden these safe mortgage bonds that everyone goes oh

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
they're completely safe. Were filled with crap and no one noticed or

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
cared because everyone was making so much

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
money and then off of that they started making other types of bonds that were even riskier and

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
riskier and riskier and eventually those risky loans started defaulting and

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that was it was like a domino just went down and it spread to foreign banks at that

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
point

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and really literally brought down the world economy for like there was a day

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
in America where the paper markets froze which means there was no short term lending

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
between hospitals can't get medicine which means municipalities can't get fluoride for

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
their water and then they did the bell out of

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
course. Bravo that was good. That was pretty good

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
press right. I very much respect as very good and your

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
main characters like in the Michael Lewis book The Big Short are the people who figured

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
out that a lot of the mortgages that were bundled into these

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
securities weren't any good that they were going to be defaults on these

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
mortgages and so that the characters in your story. The characters

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
in the nonfiction book that they're based

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
on bet against these mortgages. And then when the

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
mortgages defaulted they made a lot of money on these bets that they mean.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Yeah these were guys that it really started with Christian Bale's character Dr Michael Berry I sort of

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
call him the oracle and it's really amazing what he did he basically

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
never left his

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
office and he sat in his office listening to heavy

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
metal and he read these mortgage bonds which are fill. There are so complicated

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
they're filled with thousands of mortgages and he went on line by line and he read a bunch of

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
the

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
bonds and walked out of the room saying this is a house of cards. So he was the one

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
who really sought way before anyone

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
else and then yes he shorted the housing barns

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and then corrals character caught wind of it. Gosling's character of the two young

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
guys Jamie and Charlie played by Finn with John with Jerry. With Brad Pitt.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
These were guys that

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
believed in the market they believe that when there's a bad investment. You're supposed to have a counter investment and that's

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
how the market stabilizes so they were doing the right thing and this really they were doing

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
what the market is supposed to do

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
but there's a terrifying moment in the movie where they realize they're alone on the

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
other side of this bet. And that the whole market's been compromised and the world

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
economy could go down.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So what they thought was a good sound investment in them doing their job

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
turned out they looked basically into the abyss and to this day when you talk

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
to these guys they're still furious they're still shocked they still can't believe that no one

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
was prosecuted and most of all they're

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
disillusioned and they're also very wealthy.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
They are but it's it's funny I mean part of the movie is you know so much of our

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
culture keep score by money but I didn't see any of these guys

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
tap dancing around it's not like they're driving around in uber yachts and wearing like seven

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
thousand dollar suits I

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
mean the primary emotion you get from them is disillusionment and

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
anger. So you've managed in the Big sure to tell the

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
story of some of the main characters in the financial meltdown of

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
two thousand and eight in in a comedy in a very kind of

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
lively film and when you sat down and ask

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
yourself how do I do

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
this how do I take this kind of complicated Wall Street story that a lot of

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
people don't understand and make it understandable and also make it

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
entertaining like where did you like how did you start to wrap your head around

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
a method for doing

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
that I always viewed the movie as to move east the first

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
half is a little bit like a card counting movie where like the MIT

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
kids figure out how to count the cards at a blackjack

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
table and they're beating the evil casino. So there's a ton of energy to the front of

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
the movie you're really rooting for the. Guys it's kind of fun. It's fun to see the banks roll their

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
eyes at them and you know the guys are right.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Also some of the characters are very funny like even though they're being played very

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
seriously in a grounded way corrals character Mark bomb and his whole

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
team when you meet the real people they're very funny guys and they joke around and give each other a hard

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
time

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
so the first half of the movie does have that kind of energy and there are some laughs and it's and

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
it has like a motion to it that's really

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
great and then the second half I always viewed is where it becomes the

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
tragedy you think these guys of war in the village about the tsunami. They're up in the

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
hills and then they realize the tsunami is ten times bigger than the Hill they're standing

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
on so someone referred to the movie as a

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
traumatic tragedy a comedy which I think that is kind

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
of accurate Yeah it doesn't really

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
fit cleanly in any kind of genre box which is also what drew me to the story.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So you have some kind of ways for popular personalities. Not that I

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
necessarily familiar with all of them like actress Margot Robbie and

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
chef Anthony Bourdain and actress and singer Selena

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Gomez explained some of the more contract complicated things in there just like

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
cutaways where like Anthony Bourdain in the kitchen and

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Margot Robbie is in a bubble

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
bath. How did you come up with the idea to do cutaways like that and.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000
To find like the comedy a comic way for them to explain it.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
You know it came about from really the what I think once again is the central question of the movie which is

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
why did these people see it and we didn't when the numbers were so obvious if you looked at him.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So one of the answers we started talking about was just this kind of White Noise Pop culture that

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
America has a lot of I mean the rest of the world has it

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
too so we started talking about the idea of like we want to represent that pop culture

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
in the movie we don't just want the movie to be in office. As with Wall Street guys talking we want

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
to see what America is

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
thinking and then offer that thought I have the idea of like what would happen if

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
pop culture actually gave us usable

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
information like what would happen if Kim Carr

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
dashin every time she was on camera explain the live or rate scandal.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
You know what would happen if any time you're watching a red carpet for an award show and everyone

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
comes down in their gowns. You know each person you know talks about climate

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
change statistics and rapid change that's happening.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And so that's kind of where it came from and it felt satirical It felt funny

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
it felt like it had energy and at the same time it was a great way to get this

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
information across in a simple understandable way.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
So I imagine you

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
making this movie and shopping it to two different sets of people as you wrote

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
it giving it one first like to the experts who actually understand

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
really well what's what happened on Wall Street getting their approval and then giving

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
it to people who didn't follow what happened carefully and seeing if they

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
comprehend what you've written is that is that what you did.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
That's exactly what we did yeah it was a very interesting tug of war because we had Adam

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Davidson was the consultant on the movie was an N.P.R. guy. You know he started

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Planet Money

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and and he has it been so great piece of Alex Blumberg called the big pool of money

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
for This American Life life addict. Explain one facet of the

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
whole meltdown of two thousand and eight.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I agree I actually think it's one of the better pieces about the meltdown if anyone has a

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
chance definitely listen to it it helped me a lot. So we had Adam Davidson was really

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
rigorous thinker he's a University of Chicago guy and then obviously I was reading a

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
lot and doing my own research and then we had the real people that we would talk to as

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
well so somewhere in between that pocket and then on the other side. I have

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
to communicate with a regular audience and we had some people in focus groups at Mitla. They don't

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
even know what a stock is or how stock works

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
so there were little things that would happen like when Steve

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
corrals says sell everything at one point in the

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
movie you actually wouldn't say that you would say on wind our position

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
or it's time to call in our shorts there's another way you would phrase it so

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
the experts said you would not say sell everything and I said yeah but an audience won't

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
understand that unwind my position what does that mean.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
So it became this kind of horse trading game where what it was a key story

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
points. I would say well can he see it would it be terrible for him to

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
say so everything and they would finally confessed. No it's not crazy there are some guys that would say that so I

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
go OK they're going to keep

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
that. So. One of the lines in The Big Short

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
is that I'm paraphrasing here that Wall Street went from the

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
golf club to the strip club. You know from these you know this image of these

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
like you know boring guys

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
who like little men's club or the golf club to like you

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
know rip roaring out of control. You

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
know strip club kind of stuff so did you come up with that line with that phrase golf club to the

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
strip club.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Yeah actually gets country club to the strip club but you're correct entries up. OK Right.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Yeah I read a number that just shocked me which was that banking was

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
six percent of our G.D.P. our nation's G.D.P. in the seventy's and now it's twenty four percent.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
So it literally grew four times the size of what it used to

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
be and I would talk to people about like when I was a kid I would watch like The

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Beverly Hillbillies and Mr Drysdale the banker on there was like a lackey he was like

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
a toady and now a days that would not be the depiction of

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
a banker the banker would be the guy in charge and the oil guy would be chasing him

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
around

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
and so there was this massive shift that happened in the late seventy's and a

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
lot of it came about from.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
These new types of bombs that they created they call them you know securitizations derivatives there's

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
a lot of different names for him but basically they're new kinds of

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
bonds and it just completely changed banking to the point where those types

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
of sales became way more than secure way more than

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
securities way more than

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
stocks and the amount of profits they were making just you know quadrupled.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
And with that came a lot of lobbying power and that was when in the eighty's was in

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
the banks really said like hey let's hit Washington D.C. And let's start giving out some

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
checks which as we know is what led to the deregulation that we saw in the

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
late eighty's in the ninety's under once again under a Republican president and a Democratic

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
president this is not a right wing left wing story

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
so that line was trying to kind of show that that it went from the Country Club to

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
the strip club it went from the psych safe almost accounting like job

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
to your rock

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
star and you know like another example of how the stock market changed. I remember now

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
with growing up in the national news was on it would always end with

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
them how Wall Street did that day in Libya and today the Dow Jones was up

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
a quarter of a point or was down a half a point as opposed to up three hundred or

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
down two hundred fifty

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
absolutely volatility has gone through the roof there's no question.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
So occasionally in your story. Ryan Gosling who is.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
With Deutsche Bank in the story has characters with Deutsche Bank and he's also kind of betting

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
against the bank but. He's also the narrator of the film

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
and occasionally he comes on as the narrator and

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
says OK that didn't really happen that way but sometimes he comes on of the narrator and he

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
says what you're about to see it really happened this way

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
why did you decide to have a narrator explain when something was really fictitious and

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
then reinforce the point where something seems so outrageous but was actually true.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
You know our whole goal with this movie was that we wanted to pull the curtain back as far as

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
we could see inside this world and I really felt like you had to have this

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
conversation with the audience not the whole movie doing it but occasionally we had to

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
check in and just let the audience know we're doing the best we can to really show you

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
what

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
happened. And I was influenced by there's a Michael Winterbottom movie called twenty four Hour Party

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
People that I really love that did a lot of that and you know a little bit from my theater

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
background I'd seen it work as well so there would be certain scenes in the movie

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
that were just so unbelievable that they actually

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
happened that while corrals character was giving a speech about

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
how Bear Stearns was no good and everyone's going down and he's arguing

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
with the guys saying No Bear Stearns is fine in the middle of that speech Bear Stearns is

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
plummeting Wiley's giving this

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
speech and if you wrote that is fiction that would just be bad writing. I mean it's

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
so cartoonish and also the fact that corrals character's

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
company found out about the deal through a wrong number which is actually true. So

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I wanted to make it clear that these haphazard relationships these kind of

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
accidental you know deals that came about were absolutely true and a lot of times

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
that's how the world works.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Some of the characters in your movie have real names like Christian Bale's character Michael Berry is

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
a real name but I think most of the major characters are fictionalized

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
version of the people they're based on and the names have been changed.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
So how did you decide who was going to be based on a real person with their actual

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
name and who is going to be more of a composite or a fictionalized

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
version. Really they're all pretty much the real people it was just a matter

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
of some of them for privacy reasons didn't want their last name in there like Jamie and

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Charlie who are image arrow in Fenwick rock Those are the real guys first names and same

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
with Pitt's character not their last ages. But not their last names they just did they.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Said please don't put my last name in the movie because then everyone knows one hundred percent it's

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
me the one guy who is really kind of a composite is Gosling's character I would

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
say he's a little bit influenced by the real guy but because he's dancing in and out

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
of the movie as a character and a narrator I think that's the character where you see more

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
liberties taken where

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
he's definitely not doing an impression of the real guy but you know a lot of

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
the actions the real guy did and he is doing and there's some elements of the real guy in there.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
So let's talk about your casting Christian Bale plays Michael Barry who's a trader at a

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
hedge fund. I want you to describe his

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
character.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Brilliant and he's he's you know the one. The funny thing in Wall Street is a lot of these guys

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
will slag on each other kind of like slightly poke at each other and go He's not

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
that good he's not that good but the one guy. No one ever said a bad word about was

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Dr Michael Barry like everyone

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
acknowledges that guy is a heavyweight genius

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
and without exaggeration his job before he started a hedge fund he was in

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
his residency as a neurosurgeon and he got

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
bored. Bored with neurosurgery

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
and instead went and started this hedge fund is an amazing guy and I spend some time with

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
him and he listens to speed metal. I mean I'm not talking like light heavy metal

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
he listens to hard heavy

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
metal and he is he's on the spectrum. So he's able to hyper

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
focus and he will sit in his office for sixteen straight hours reading

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
documents. He's a sweet sweet guy and

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
his experience through this whole thing was just really miserable. I mean when he was

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
certain that he was right in the markets didn't change he got very physically

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
ill and almost had his lower intestine half of his lower intestine

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
removed and then the second that he sold his position or unwound his position. Instantly the

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.000
pains went away

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
so Christian spent a lot of time with them they. An entire day together just sitting in

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
a room talking and Christians very method so Dr Perry gave

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Christian his real close and see in the movie that he tends to wear this one T. shirt and shorts

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
a lot that he actually wore during the period

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
and Christian learned how to play speed metal drums

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
and so it was an amazing process to work I mean we all know Christian Bale's one of the

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
great living actors and to really just see him become this person was was kind of

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
jaw dropping.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
So let's talk about the character Steve chorale plays and when you describe the

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
character he plays a character. Mark

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
bomb who's based on a real guy Steve

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Eisman and very very strictly based on him actually is really doing

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
the character based on

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
him and Mark Bond's a fascinating character he really is

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
a crusader and he's really a guy who looks for corruption

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
he looks for the B.S. out there and he looks for companies that are

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
fluffing their numbers that aren't

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
legit and he relishes you know shorting them or putting sell orders on

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
them and he had a long history of busting these bogus

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
subprime companies back in like the late ninety's early two thousand

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
and he had this team of people that are played beautifully by Jeremy

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Strong Hamish Linkletter and rave

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Spall and they all sort of had this distrust of the system their basic approach

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
was you have to prove to us that your company is legit. Otherwise we assume you're

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
not so when this trade came across corralled it's character Mark

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
bombs desk. He was more than ready for it when no one else

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
was and it quickly becomes a bit of an a Habs crusade for

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000
him sort of the Ultimates corruption deal.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
The ultimate sign that the and he's right all along the entire system is

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
rotten and he's the guy who sort of represents the audience a little bit his

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
outrage matches on. Ours and at a certain point a kind of a lot like a hobby. He loses

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
his mind a little bit and really it all becomes about this personal

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
crusade and you're really kind of worried for me is he going to wait too

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
long to sell is he going to self-destruct

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
and Corella just did an amazing job I mean he really transformed as I was put on

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:20.000
like twenty twenty five

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
pounds. Why did he need to do that why did he think he needed to do that. You

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
know there's there's a quality to the real guy. The real guy is not a bad looking guy

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
but he's a little bit heavier his clothes don't always fit him well I wanted Steve to be a

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
little bit sloppy. I didn't want him to be Steve's decent looking guys usually

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.000
in good

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
shape and these guys are all the guys with the you know the lousy clothes

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
the bad haircuts the guys who can't make eye contact so I needed Steve to kind

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
of just be a little off balance and a little uncomfortable and God

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
bless Steve he did it and

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
then the real guy's very larger than life guy really good guy but definitely larger than life

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
and and Steve found a way to really play him in this grounded way that still

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
had vulnerability to it yet right as anger and I really I

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
really think it's one of the best things Steve's ever done and he kind of blew everyone away on this

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
movie. So you cofounded Funny or Die and you do some videos for Funny or Die and it's

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
a it's a. It's a

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
comedy website that has a lot of different contributors and

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
you recently did something very funny called done although Trump has

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
with George Lopez like the Mexican Donald Trump would you describe

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
that video.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Yeah that was a piece I wrote with a Owen Burke who's the new creative head of Funny or

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Die actually interesting lady whose dad was the created Nightline was

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
like a tiny and it is well yeah kind of interesting and now a son runs Funny or Die.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
So the premise was well I just started laughing with Alan about the idea of like well wait a minute

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
out of the Mexicans feel about you know all the drunk college students. Come down there and all the

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
criminals that escape and go hide in Mexico

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
so we came up with this guy then I'll do a trump as who's the know the equivalent

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
the Mexican equivalent of Donald Trump and he wants to build a wall to keep

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
the Americans out and he wants to get rid of Sammy Hagar is to kill.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
And he wants to get rid of Senor frauds and he wants to get rid of these factories that don't pay the

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
workers any money and pollute the rivers and it was funny we were reading it as sort of

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
an absurdist sketch and about halfway through we realized like wait a minute this guy is some good

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
points. He also wants to build a wall separating America

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
from Mexico because the Mexican cartels exist only because Americans have

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
an insatiable appetite for cocaine. He

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
says America America's color should be red white and below.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
I

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
think they go and wrote that line I love that line. Absolutely and by the

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
way kind of a valid point.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
So it was it was amazing that thing caught fire I think it got like twenty twenty five

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
million views on Facebook and a couple million on our sites and it just.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Yeah it was very cool and we specifically had Mr Lopez do it in Spanish too which

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
I thought was very

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
cool. It's subtitled on Funny or Die.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
I have a really funny other sketch I did but it's. In Mandarin do you think you

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
could play that sure what you're getting the do you really have a

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
mandarin sketch. Well

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
actually they translated the landlord at one point into about twenty different languages.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
So there really is a mandarin subtitled landlord that's out there but no I have not

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
recently written a mandarin

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
sketch. How do you think your sense of humor has changed over the

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
years.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
I definitely think through the years I probably started more in my teenage

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
early twenty's as

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
just a fan of absurdist comedy you know I grew up on money Python and Steve

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Martin I define that as I've gotten older I've just taken more of an interest in a lot of things in

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
the world. So that that leaks into my comedy more but I still think at root I

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
love comedy that has a prank quality to it a comedy that messes with

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
audiences and appends expectations or you think it's one thing and it's another

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
thing I'll always love that like I'm forty seven years old and I swear if they

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
didn't have caller ID I would still be doing crank phone calls. Did you do painful phone calls as

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
a kid. Oh my God constantly. Oh yeah. What was your

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
thing.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
But it was age fifteen through college we had one we would do in college

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
where we would just everyone was constantly getting pizza. You know in

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
the dorm room so you'd get a call and I'd be like hey it's you know whatever pizza place.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Tony's Pizza giving your pre call be in the lobby in two minutes with your pizza you take the elevator down you get your

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
pizza you pay the guy you go back

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
up so we would just sit around because they had a student guide and so it's people's names you would call and

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
go hey is this you know Ben Levitan the oh yeah you know it's your prick call your pizza's company

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
you know I don't order pizza.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Look I don't have time for you smart asses. You know just come get your pizza.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
I'm telling you I don't order pizza and he's go like look I am so sick of you

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
spoiled kids messing around with me I'm down here with your pizza get and then Ben Eventually we talked him

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
into a fight and be like I'll fight you right now and then my friend and I would run

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
downstairs and go sit in the T.V..

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
And we watch these four or five jacked up guys come out of the elevator pacing back and

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
forth flexing their muscles ready for a fight heat.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Did that. Dozens of times and and we tell people that their you know they were having a hot

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
tub delivered to their dorm room

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
or we call him up and tell him that I was an exchange student that I met the boss because you could see in

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
that student guy they were a Spanish major It's like Oh I'm well I'm at the bus station I'm in

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
from Nicaragua. Like what are you talking about. You know I'm supposed to stay with you your Spanish

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
based and.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
We were idiots. We were full. On idiots but oh my god would we laugh.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Did you ever feel the least bit of guilt for doing this.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
No none whatsoever they were all why not why not because. Because the guys you

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
had to

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
know I mean I went to Penn State for one year and I transferred to Temple University and there's a lot of

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
guys at Penn

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
State who are very jacked up and like to think of themselves as like want

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
to be football players and frat guys and the idea that he's

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
stirring up a bunch of those guys to come down into the lobby ready to

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
fight in the hot tub one was harmless no one ever did anything with just calling in

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
the person big walk there's a hot tub and you. You know Same with the exchange student would all just kind of go away so we

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
weren't taking anyone's money we're putting anyone in danger is kind of giving them

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
a chaotic hard time which I think is good I think that's healthy on some

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
level so long as there's not serious emotional distress.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Now I know early in your career when you were at Second City

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
and should you I'm sorry to interrupt I'm going to totally interrupt you. Yes you really realize now I am

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
definitely going to crank phone call you at one

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
point it's going to happen. What are you going to

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
do but you going to I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do but I swear to you I

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
promise in the next six months you're getting a prank phone call you're going to forget to think

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
oh he's just kidding around you threatening me it is not a threat.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
It's a playful warning if you see that we're going to talk afterwards.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
OK All right OK it's common.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
OK OK So one more question Has making the big short about

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
the financial collapse of two thousand and eight and Wall Street's role in

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
that has that changed your relationship with your stockbroker.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
My financial adviser love the movie he really loved it.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
I have a cousin who's in private equity is two and I had a little conversation with

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
him before I saw. You know this movie

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
is not targeting bankers banking is good we actually need

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
banking but banking that overreaches are banking that has corruption is not

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
good and can do a lot of destruction and right now banking just has way too much

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
power so we really went out of our way with the movie never to point the finger at any one

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
individual we

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
really believe it's a systemic issue so so far all the banking and finance people

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
in my life have really enjoyed the movie but who knows I could be talking to you

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
in two months from now and I'll have a black guy after someone's punched me so we'll

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
see I was thinking you could talk to your financial analyst or manager

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
or whatever their title is on a on a higher level than you ever could before.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Oh well actually that's funny I mean as far as talking to my

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
financial advisor. I have

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
annoyed the crap out of I have gone

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
and talked to these real people these geniuses and they've told me things and I go back to my guy

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
and I just go mad. You never going to believe it there's a you know there's a bubble in

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
this and we have to short. This and always it's the same thing he takes a two second pause and then

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
just relax.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
God bless him he's got the patience of Job but and thank God he doesn't always listen to me.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
And I'm a case in great to talk with you again thank you so much. And I wish you Happy Holidays and a wonderful two thousand

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
and sixteen.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Terry always a pleasure. Happy holidays to you as well and and much love to

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
my hometown of Philadelphia.
