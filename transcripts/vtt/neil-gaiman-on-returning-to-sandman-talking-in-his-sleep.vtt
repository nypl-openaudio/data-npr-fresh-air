This is FRESH AIR. Our guest Neil Gaiman's introduced his horror fantasy

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
comic The Sandman in one thousand nine hundred nine it attracted a large adult audience.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Norman Mailer described it as a comic strip for

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
intellectuals its hero was a godlike creature known as dream or

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Morpheus he was named one of the endless A group of seven immortal

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
siblings each named for what they embodied desire despair

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
delerium destruction destiny and death.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Gaiman's Sandman stories dealt with mortals and gods alike and were considered

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
groundbreaking for the time the seventy five issue series ended in one thousand nine hundred six. But

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for its twenty fifth anniversary game in return to write a six part mini series that's

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
just been collected in one volume called The Sandman Overture.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Neil Gaiman's has also written many bestselling books for adults and children

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
including American Gods. Coraline and Stardust the last two were made into movies.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
He spoke with FRESH AIR producer Sam

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Berger near game and welcome to FRESH AIR.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Thank you so much.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So you hear a Sandman is known by many names. Some of those are dream or Morpheus and

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
he's and charge he's the Lord of the dream world. He's a personification of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the act of dreaming can you describe his activities for us.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The upon a

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
miscarriage of Sandman I decided that he would be really interesting

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to create a character who was dream who was

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the in connotation of the act of dreaming. He's one of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
a family of seven siblings beginning with destiny and

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
death and ending with despair and delirium.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
He is incredibly

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
stiff slightly pompous rather lonely hidebound and obsessed

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
by rules. And has very little

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
sense of himself.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
He is many many things but empathetic is not really one of

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
them although he slightly softer than he likes to believe himself to be.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And he's not very

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
funny he really is which is

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
always one of those things I enjoy because it allows me to have other characters around

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
him being funny.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So you said the Sandman is part of a family that you call the endless these immoral

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
siblings whose names can be only start with the letter D. there's death. Desire

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
despair destiny destruction delirium and dream. So they're

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.000
like gods but

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
they function and exist differently than the other guys in your book

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
your books your comics are populated with all sorts of

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
gods because their existence doesn't rely on faith. Can you explain that a little

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
more. I love the idea that basically gods rely on worship.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
They rely on

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
belief out there in the world wherein you can tell the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
importance of any day or two by how many temples they have how

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
many worshippers they have in the real world and. I assume it's the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
same on whatever godly stretch out there

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
on the endless simply exist they don't care if you believe

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
in them or not they are these anthropomorphic personifications

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
of fundamental things to do with life and they are doing

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.000
their

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
job so because we dream because we despair

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
because we desire they they exist as a function of those things

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
are exactly the idea was that Destiny came into existence just

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
before there was any life death came into existence as

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
there was life because life now contains the potential for

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
death. And so on and. Really a lot of it went

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
back to when I started writing Sandman back

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
in one thousand nine hundred seventy. I began to write it I was thinking that there really

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
just weren't any comics out there

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
with families and and I love family dynamics

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I love the way that families work or don't work I love the way that

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
families behave I love the way the families interact and it seems like that would

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
be a really fun kind of thing to put in and when I came over to America to

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
do signings. People would say to me. We

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
love the Sandman and his family. They're a wonderful dysfunctional

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
family and it was in the fray said about her before and

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I said well hang on Explain to me what is

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
a dysfunctional family and people would explain. And after a while I realized that what Americans called

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
a dysfunctional family was what we in England called the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
family having never encountered any

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
functional one

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
functional your main character Salman as a hero but not a

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
typical comic book hero you see more of a tragic hero with flaws that

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
eventually causes

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
undoing as you said he's arrogant he's humorless he's up tight and just about

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the worst person to ever remain to correlation simply he really

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
is terrible were you careful to make sure that with all of these

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
flaws he was still likable

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
enough. No I was perfectly willing for

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
him to be unlikeable and I think that

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
somehow what works in his favor. He

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
is absolutely appalling

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
sometimes but there's one storyline where you discover

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
that he'd sentenced essentially an old girlfriend

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to hell for ten thousand years basically for pissing him

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
off and. When this is pointed out to him and

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
pointed out in that he did the wrong thing he promptly

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Nobili heads off into hell to bring her back and try and do the right thing but you have to be

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
very aware that this is somebody who had

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
really sent somebody to help the ten thousand years because

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
she irritated him because she spent him.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Your editor Karen Berger has said that Sandman was the first modern comic that attracted a

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
large female readership What do you think women responded to in

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
those comics. I think they responded really really well to the fact that it

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
wasn't a pre-adolescent male power fantasy.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And it had a lot of women in it it had a lot of active women in it too a part of

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
the story when I started writing Sandman.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I thought you know I

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
should probably make sure that I have as many women in

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the story as men and that they are

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
as integral to the

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
story as the male characters and that was what I tried to do from that

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
point out sometimes failing sometimes

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
succeeding and I think that that was the biggest thing that made

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
it happen. It got very strange for me because I would get.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
At conventions large man in sweaty T. shirts coming up to me

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and pounding my head

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and saying you brought women and my store for the first time.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And I would always have to bite back to say. If you sweep it. They may come back.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But it really was comics back then was a

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
male

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
preserve it was male dominated and one of the things I

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
love now is the fact that there really are as

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
many female readers of comics and graphic novels as there are

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
males it is no longer a gender determined medium. Which always seem

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to me to be completely bucking mad from the beginning.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I always thought that. Comics were somewhat of a strange art form in that they're they're often

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
about action and movement and all this kinetic energy yet they're portrayed in static images.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The magic of comics is

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
that there are three people involved in any comic who's

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
whoever's writing it and whoever's drawing it and then there's whoever's reading

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
it because they are creating the movement. They are

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
creating the illusion of time

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
passing there's a wonderful moment in Scott McClellan's book

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Understanding Comics where he

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
shows a man standing behind a woman or possibly vice versa.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Rome with an axe and then the next

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
panel is a carter

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
way to the building there and a scream.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And he points out that you as a

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
reader just murdered the character he didn't do it and

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
that to me is the joy of comics your imagination needs to do an

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
awful lot.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
You're saying Man comics of always been about storytelling and many writers and storytellers have

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
actually appeared in the pages one of

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
them is William Shakespeare and he said one of the most famous issues if your run was

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
about up in the first performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream for an audience of fairies you

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
also ended the series with issue with

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Shakespeare in doubt about whether he had lived his life. Well

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
because he had spent his life as a writer and he

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
says whatever happened to me in my life happened to me as a writer of plays I'd fall

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
in love or fallen

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
lost and at the height of my passion I would think so this is how it feels and I were tied up in

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
pretty words I watched my life as if it were happening to some. Else. My

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
son died and I was hurt but I watched my hurt and even relished it a little for now

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I could write a real

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
death. A true loss. That's a pretty ambivalent description of the writer's

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
life. I have no idea if that was true for

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Shakespeare but I knew that was true for me and wanted

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
to put that in that it always felt like

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the price of being a writer. Was

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that you would even in the most terrible moments there was there was a

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
little phantom the asian of you sitting on your shoulder with a

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
notebook going I can use this. OK Look at look at look at the way

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
that the the light is glinting off the broken plastic on the road next

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
to the blood. You can use this and it was it was a very strange

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
feeling for me peculiarly I think I kind of exercised it.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Definitely sort of took a step back once a man was done and I

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
definitely felt like I had taken a step further back into my

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
life and that just happen naturally you don't have to take certain measures to make

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
sure you're not too

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
detached. It definitely happen naturally and maybe it

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
was part of aging as well and maybe part of it at that time was saying goodbye to

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
sentiment there was writing Sandman for me was the

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
most intense period of my

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
life because the fictional characters were more

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
real to me or at least as real to me as anything else that was happening.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I was spending more time with them than I was with my own family. I was

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
you know eight hours a

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
day I would be sitting huddled over

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
my computer or scratching still drawings to try and figure

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
out how to get from one panel to the next or working out the dialogue.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
In your same comics you created a whole cosmology that includes. Your own immortal

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
beings and also all these gods from many different belief systems me you

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
have Norse gods christian gods Greek

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
gods Japanese gods. I read that when you were supposed to be studying fear

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
barmitzvah you could jolt your instructor to tell you non-canonical. Religious

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
stories. Oh yes when I was I mean that was

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
the joy for me of religion the stuff that I

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
loved was

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
myth. And as a kid my favorite books were things like.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Roger Alonso lingering tales of the Norseman and tales of ancient Egypt

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and when I was studying for my Bar Mitzvah. I was

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
very lucky because I had

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
a very orthodox Cantor Reverend my

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Olive who

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I could get off the subject of the stuff that we were meant to be

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
doing and on to the subject of

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
wonderful strangest parts of the

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Midrash Weird Tales of commentary

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and it was essentially although I didn't know it at the time the mythology of Judaism.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
It was the stuff that had crept off into the corners that became part of the

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.000
oral

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
tradition and. I loved that I didn't know. When

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
I was twelve that not everybody knew that for example.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Adam had had three wives. That was his third wife I sort of vaguely assume

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
that everybody must know that because I've been nice to get on the

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
subject and that for the record the

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
first wife was less who then went off and had sex with demons.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So birthmarks it was exactly and spawned. Monsters

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and dark creatures.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
The second wife was made in front of Adam.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
From the bones up. And he got to watch her being created

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
skin and hair and all and was so revolted by this he wouldn't go near

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
her which is why God had to put him made her vanish

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
and put Adam to sleep to create

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
the so that he wouldn't actually get to see

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
the creation process and I love that story and.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Then as an adult going to look for it found myself reading so

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
many obscure books of Jewish mythology until

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
finally I discovered it I think in a Robert Robert Graves book and when I

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
hadn't pollution later this I didn't imagine it did actually

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
exist. Well that idea of us. As a kid listening to all the stories

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and stories that are part of the canon it resonates so much

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
with Sandman and also a lot of the other work where there are

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
these stories behind the official stories and there's Or there's

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
always something behind what you're perceiving in

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
reality I think that for me seems like

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
a way to talk about the world wherein none of

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
us exist in a world that is the same world that any of the rest of us live

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.000
in the world that's important is the world behind each of our eyes.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Which is something that none of the rest of us can access and more

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
than that it's the strange impossible bits the idea of

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
dreaming always fascinates me the idea that even the most normal

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
people close their eyes for six seven eight hours a night

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and during that time. For several hours go. Absolutely and utterly

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
stark staring mad.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Is beautiful. I think I love my dreaming process because.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
One of the things that my dreaming process does is sort on stories for me I will go to

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
sleep stuck on what happens next I will wake

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
up somewhere boys in the back room have been

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
moving heavy furniture around.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
They've been digging they've been painting they've been plastering they present it with

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
the

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
solution. Well Neil Gaiman's thank you so much for speaking with us today.
