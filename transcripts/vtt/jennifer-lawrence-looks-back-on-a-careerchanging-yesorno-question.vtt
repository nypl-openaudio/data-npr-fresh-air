00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000

Nobody's getting along and joy is having trouble supporting her two young

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
children when she invents a mop that is self wringing so that you don't hurt

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
your hands wringing it out she can't find anyone to sell it until she goes to Q B

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
C and meets with an exact played by Bradley Cooper. He likes the mop and gets

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
one of Q.V. sees best on air pitchman to sell it on

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000

mop in this scene joy arrives at Kew B.C. unannounced and corners

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the Bradley Cooper character trying to get a second chance.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Amid a meeting with the leaders.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Go home and watch the numbers on television.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Thanks fifty thousand

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
moms borrowing and owing every dollar including your home.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It could have been a better. The tide of another show. I don't. One time

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
or anyone else to try it should be me.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We don't have celebrities was most of the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
selling us who showed you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
some who sold it to you who taught you how to use it and who convinced you that it was

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
great to you thought it was worthless. She was missing gifts.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
That's a scene from Joy Jennifer Lawrence welcome to FRESH AIR As part of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
your preparation for the film did you try out the miracle mop the self

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
or any miracle

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
mop. I did not I probably should have i can i did

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
i always I did I did mom but

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I didn't have a miracle I have a sponge and so did mom and then there was a mop in

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
my trailer. So I would practice that you know practice like technique

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and just kind of getting getting used to it and there were so many miracle mop on

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
set I would start working them and I'm like really just trying to study because the amazing thing about joy a lot of people

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
have and pensions are they have ideas and they bring it to somebody else and say I have this idea I

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
don't know how to make it but Joy grew up in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a metal garage so she was in complete control of all of her creations on this

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
is how I wanted to be made which is very different than just having an idea so

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I studied the model more to just try to understand some of these

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
mind peeling back and looking at each you know how would you think this clipping out of this and then

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
a cop pulled in here and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
then all of that fascinated me so I dealt with the mob but when I first showed Bradley Cooper in the showroom.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The mommy watched me and I was like no no no that's not how you mob and he showed me how

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to properly. Read the Bradley Cooper actually used the miracle mob

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
when he was in college he did his

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
mom watched T.V. see every day they always keep easy boxes in the house and he knew all about

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that world and I knew nothing and I had an O.C.D. mom. So

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
she would always give us some stories and tell us what to do but she couldn't

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
actually live with it being done the wrong way. It never actually mattered you'd always end up doing

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
it. So one of

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the trademarks of David Russell's movies particularly the trilogy that you're in

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Silver Linings Playbook American Hustle and

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
joy is that they're very kinetic there's always movement happening like

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
characters walking in and out of the frame like scene just kind of blend into

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
another and I'm wondering how aware you are of

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that when you're on camera and the film is being shot do you have any sense of what it's

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
going to look like how it's going to be edited how kinetic it's going to

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
be no and it's such a

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
great

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
thing that you know every time you do a movie scary because you can read a script

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and say I love the script. This is great costar this movie is going to be great but

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
you don't really have control over it you know you can walk onto a set and you like the set

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
it's terrible you know you start watching the director and you don't have any

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
control but with David I have a thousand percent trust. So

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I all I do is focus on my performance as until seeing the movie that I see

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
an amazing camera move. That he did you know are Notice that Eastern Airlines like Zoom Zoom in past all of

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
the people or something like that on the day I don't I don't pay attention

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
to any of

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
it one of the things he does not like to do is to say cut.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So from your perspective as an actor in his film. What difference does it

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
make whether he's yelling cut or not.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I don't know I've never really particularly noticed I'm not really calling. I mean I think that he

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
likes everybody refers to his sets you know everybody everybody says the same thing that it's crazy it's

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
hectic you know I've said it too it's a tactic. It's just not you know but I think

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
that there's a real

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
specificity that we just don't really realize that he's doing all of

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
that on purpose he wants all of the energy translated and on the scene in

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
the movie he wants everybody on their feet every. It's on their toes you never know when the camera's going to move and

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
be on you so you are in the scene. The whole time of the cameras I mean the real movie is watching the camera

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
guys try to keep up with all this there's a little white

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
guy was. You know like a light on a stick and they're just running around trying to do and

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
get everything so when you call

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
cut and everything stops everything

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
dies and the whole action and then you have to get started up again I think

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
probably just trying to keep momentum and keep the energy up and keep people on their toes.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
How many takes do you like to do when you're shooting a scene and how does that compare say with Robert De

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Niro who who you've worked with on. Other films with David O.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Russell. I've never noticed.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Bob feeling one way or the other about about

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
takes David doesn't really do a lot of takes you know the first time I did the Q.B.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
see her first time on camera you know and there was a. I had to quickly

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
memorize this monologue I didn't really know that I was going to do it which is my fault I don't

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
really pay attention to what I was doing when I came into work and I was trying to

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
memorize it and David did a whole three sixty shot around my head of there was a cut move on and I was like oh my god.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Please please let me have another one I think it depends completely on the scene because

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
sometimes I feel like it dies. You know after especially with

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
emotional scenes.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It's fresh two maybe three times and then you just lose the feeling like

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that adrenaline just kind of goes away and then you're just copying what you were doing before which is

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
fine because it's necessary and part of the job. Sometimes it's dialogue.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It's not until the tenth or eleventh time and all this and you start hearing it you're like oh that's what I'm saying

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
so it's really just a pan.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So the first movie that you made with David O. Russell with Silver Linings Playbook.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
You won an Oscar for your role in that. So I want to play a scene

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
from that Bradley Cooper play someone who has bipolar disorder he gets out of a mental

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
facility mental health facility at the beginning of the film.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
He's obsessed with. Adding back with his wife who has left him in the meantime you play his best

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
friend sister in law. You're a young widow who has your own mental health

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
issues but you get him you understand him and you've enlisted him to

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
be your partner in a dance

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
competition but one day he doesn't show up for rehearsal because his father played by Deniro needs

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
him at the Eagles game. The father is a bookmaker and he's got a lot of money riding on this game

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
but Cooper gets into a fight at a tailgate party never makes it into the stadium when the Eagles lose

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
the father blames Bradley Cooper's character for the loss and for bringing bad

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
luck and he's blaming you too for bringing bad luck because you

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
think he thinks you're taking up too much of Bradley Cooper stime So this tape scene takes

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
place at the home of the Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro characters their family

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
after the game after the Eagles

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
lose and you walk in and Deniro tells you

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
that the bad luck is basically your fault.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Ever since ever since he was with you ever since you think that I'm why today is out. That's

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
right you why why the reason why today happened. I think so let's talk about

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that be my guest the first night the Patten I met at my sister's The Eagles beat the

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
forty nine ers handily forty to twenty six.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the daughters seven to five and L.C.S..

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons twenty seven to

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
fourteen the third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series tended to.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Well one I think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks fourteen to seven it was with you he was with me.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
We went for a run and there have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
day and a padded been with me like he was supposed to he would have gotten a fight he

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
wouldn't be in trouble. Maybe he'll be the New

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
York Giants. Since But it's all written

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
all girls.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
That's Jennifer Lawrence in a scene from Silver Linings Playbook. David O. Russell sometimes

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
gives actors music to listen to to help set the mood and he give a new music to listen to for

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
you for your

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
roles.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
A little bit. That's not we normally start arguing

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
about that though I always think it's annoying but it's necessary but I was

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
asleep one time we were flying to New York together and I was fast asleep on the flight

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and all of us on there was an

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
ear bud Shot tonight. From Raging Bull as I crossed.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So it's basically everything that David and I argue about on the day that I think is

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
unnecessary David I don't want to talk about the thing I don't want you to go through the whole movie with me like I know what

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
the movie is about let's go oh I don't want to listen to

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
this song when I see the movie and I see what he's doing and I always put everything together.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I'm always wrong it will always change something in some way that I didn't

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
know you know in silver linings and proudly and I are at a diner and I'm talking about

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
how I got fired from work by having sex with everybody in the office.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I had read the scene one way. Bradley and I had both read it a certain way were doing the scene and then David

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
told us to do the entire thing and slow motion what seemed like a

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
crazy note and we did and that is the

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
scene that that's the take they ended up using it looks phenomenal. I felt so weird

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and you know I questioned. I think on the next i'll finally stop questioning

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
him. So what was the difference between the way you were doing it in the slow motion in terms of

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
the meaning it gave you that scene.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I was just doing it very matter of fact you know this is what happened I you know so I

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
had sex with everybody in the office and then I got fired and you know so then I sued them for sexual harassment just kind

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
of how somebody would discuss over dinner. How you got fired from your job

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
without really any feeling in it you know just kind of yeah that's

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
happened. And when he told me to do it in slow motion I

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
realized I was to do

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
thing. Bradley And

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
that changed the whole meaning of that scene in the moment.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Because And then that made complete sense because of course of course you would be you're probably doing

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that probably seduce people without even knowing that she's doing it that's where her comfort lies

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
is being found sex

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
even people. How did you get the role of Katniss in The Hunger Games. What did you have to

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
do in the audition. Did you have to show off your use of a bow and arrow.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I didn't know that came after the job.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I auditioned I auditioned with the scene after I've

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
been chosen after I volunteer and I have to say goodbye to my

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
family and scene with Pete out in the cave. When his leg

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.000
is

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
hurt. Yeah I auditioned

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and director cried which I took as a

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
good sign and then I left

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and they offered it to me I really wanted it really badly.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I love the books I love the idea of it and then when they offered it to

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
me I took a few days before saying yes which an executive

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
told me later he thought it was a negotiating move

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and it really hit me what a huge decision it was it

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
was such a. You know Twilight has come out and we had seen how big

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
those were and how instant that was and I had really you know kind of done Indies

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and I just thought it needed more thought you know yes or

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
no question very rarely changes your entire life just saying yes to something

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
so I just thought it needed some thought so I thought about it for a few days and I said yes I'm very

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
happy I did what was the

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
thought process like when you were weighing the pros and cons of saying yes. What were some of

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
the things in each

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
column.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I would go you know if I was sitting I remember sitting with. Friend eating and I was

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
just wondering you know what was going to be like a year from now those movies come out my having and I want to be

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.000
able to do

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
this my parents' house when I go home like.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
That's not private our neighbors going to you know when I was right about all of these things my parents did eventually have

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
to move. I was just thinking about fame really and also just kind

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
of my future I don't know if men do this but as a woman I've always imagined

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.000
being a mother

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and I've always loved acting but I didn't think it

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
would take up a huge part of my life I I thought you know I'll act I'll do some

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
movies because I really love it and I was so happy I was originally just on a sitcom and I was happy

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
to just stay on the set

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
forever. And so I was kind of a little bit more casual about acting

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and it was more kind of focused on of my future kind of as a human and being a mom

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and I don't know what would that be like being a super incredibly

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
famous person

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and how would that affect everything in my future. I just wanted to just think

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
about it.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And so when you decided to say yes we did you feel resigned to

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
the downside of

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
theme.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
A little bit. I mostly just kind of said you know what I love this character I

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
love this movie I believe in it and I'm going to say yes for the same reasons that I would say yes to any

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Andy and

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
then but I was still afraid of those things but I remember there was a moment when I was on set under games and I

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
was thinking about my life and I was like you know what

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I don't like going out. I'm talking total homebody. I'm always

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
looking for excuses not to go out I was like I'm actually probably built for this. So I

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
can now use fame as an excuse I can't go there into

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
fame and I do. I don't think I've ever heard

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
that before that it's a great and you wouldn't you go well you know if we had each

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
other's numbers I'd be like Man I

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
gotta come over here and we'll drink wine I'm too

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
famous to go to that right.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So. I know a little bit about a bow and arrow because when I was in summer

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
camp we were taught archery So I feel like I'm qualified

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
to be so qualified to ask you what was it like to learn how to become

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
a master Archer. It was really cool.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
I really really enjoyed archery I had an amazing and struck her to

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
know she was Georgian she was an excellent instructor

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
very strict you know if I had bad form she'd pinch my ear. She

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
would generally put up with anything and it totally changed my body it was so

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
crazy when I went back for the fitting for the second movie for Catching Fire my shoulders were two

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
inches broader my right arm is one inch longer than my left

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
arm permanently I

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
guess but I really enjoy it. She should actually punch your ear if you did

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
something wrong not punch it pinch it open shit. Sorry God I'm happy we straighten that

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
out she punched me and I had a great. So

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
what was one of

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
the worst things you had to put yourself through in making the Hunger Games movies.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
In durance was you know you really have to get in shape just to be able to film those movies

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
because whatever I'm doing whatever you

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
see whatever action sequences it's running fighting whatever it is you know that's we're doing that for twelve hours a day or

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
more the water stuff is very tricky and catching fire all of the

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
water stuff was done and November and December in Atlanta in freezing cold water

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
so it's just a horrible feeling when you're shivering when you're dry and then have to dive into freezing cold water is

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
just the

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
worst and I perforated my eardrum doing a water

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
stand when I had to jump in the water the jet perforated at your job and I'm an

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
idiot so you know I couldn't hear for three days and I was like I don't have to go to the doctor and now I have like a

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.000
permanent

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
ear problems. Can you hear that here. I can hear fine it gets a little painful

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
sometimes when flying. Overall I'm totally OK and don't need to be. Whining about

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
it you mention fire I

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
mean one of the things your character does is where like a

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
flaming flaming costume an address that.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Breaks into flames when you twirl like

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
what magicians use.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
It was all C.G. The only real fire we really owe. Why did I think was on the

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
first the

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
first movie I had to run through a trail there were fire balls being fired at me and

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
so these trees would ignite and fire and so they would mark the trees and mark

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
a path run through here you'll be safe these trees are going to

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
explode and he starts running and all the trees start exploding you can't see the tape

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
anymore so I'm right. I have no idea what tree is going to explode. It was the

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
scariest thing I've ever done to my darling because I was really running through a forest of exploding trees with

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
fire and somebody made a video of it and I was just like how on earth did they insure

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
me to do that. So what kind of

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
precautions do you insist on when you're doing a film like that safety precautions.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
None really. I always just kind of assume by the time I'm there they figured it out.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
There are some things and harness

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
work that I don't know scares me of the what it was like these bans that push

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
against what I assume would be like my female organ area and I'm just

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
like now this doesn't seem right to be hanging from this is this much pressure for hours

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I put my foot down about that the other day at work I was like I have to be able to have children one day I don't

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
know what you're getting from my uterus for

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
four This is FRESH AIR I'm Terry

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Gross back with Jennifer Lawrence she stars in the new film joy which is one of

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
three films along with Silver Linings Playbook an American

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Hustle that she's made with director David O. Russell Lawrence is also starring in

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
The Hunger Games films the fourth and final episode is currently in theaters.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
As a woman who is now an action star and in addition to being in. The movie star.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
What are some of the things that viewers project onto you in your

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
action star

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
persona.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
You mean like project on to me and my personal life yeah. I don't know I feel like if I go to a

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
spinning class oh my God I better

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
I can't quit. Everyone's like. Katniss

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
sucked out I don't know I don't

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
know the X. I mean I think that there's you're always aware of this of the celebrity in

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
general that there can be one moment you know I always hear my friends and

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
family will tell a story about a celebrity. I don't think they're very nice because they were

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
offered popcorn and they said you know I'm not a big fan

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
of popcorn is like who doesn't like popcorn. I don't think I like them anymore and I'm like

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Oh God. Like well how many things have I said

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
like it's amazing how you celebrities there's this some

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
bizarre thing where like you say one thing you do one thing you know what if you don't know a

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
person how you can judge that your entire being based on you know

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
one thing that you've said it's a huge amount of pressure.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Your breakthrough role was in Winter's Bone an independent film and you

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
played a teenage girl in the Ozark Mountains where there isn't much work except cooking

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.000
and selling

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
meth which your character's father and his friends do but your father's arrested

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
he puts up the house for Bale then skips town. So unless you can track him down

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
your family which is already pretty poor is going to lose their house which is

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
basically all your family

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
has so you're going around talking to all your father's friends trying to figure out

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
where is he so I want to play a scene in which you're knocking on the door of one of the leaders

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
of this meth ring and that guy's wife answers the door.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.000
You

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
got the wrong

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
life. She Bay

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Marie my dad's Jessup Dolly.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Oh

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
yeah here for trouble are

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
you. You know my name is one of my nephews is Buster Leavell And didn't

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
he shoot your dad I want

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
to yes so that I got enough and it was

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
me I settled up there so nothing.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
She didn't like I said

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
only what is it you want. I got a

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
real bad need to talk with

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000
them and got no need talk to you.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
But I need to I really really got to ma'am

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
please. Some of our blood at least is the

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
same thing that supposed to mean something and that what is always

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:03.000
said

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
and you got no man could do

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
this. Oh man I don't know I guess Jennifer

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Lawrence in the scene from Winter's Bone. So for this part you

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
were told you were too pretty. So what did you do to change that so you

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
could get the part.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Well

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
they turned me down and then they moved casting to New

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
York and I put myself on a red eye to just show

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
up to casting the next day in New

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
York. So that always helps right

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
I not showering no

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
makeup eventually they went

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
oh she's right. She's not you you grew up in Kentucky

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
near Louisville in Louisville in

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Louisville and. In school we were US legit because you've done such athletic

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
things for The Hunger Games. Yeah our parents had a rule we all had to be in

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
sports. So I played softball basketball as a

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
cheerleader. And field hockey. Did you enjoy

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
it you know. Not at all I did team sports.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Why I

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
don't like being I have always done things I agree about being and I heard.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
I felt that way in school I even felt that way and field trips I was like oh felt

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
like cattle or something I don't know I just wanted to

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
break free he pays individual. So I don't know there was something about

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
team sports classes. I didn't take well to I didn't like it did you

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
like solo sport.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Yeah eventually when I started learning or learning archery I really enjoyed that you know with archery you can

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
see yourself as you practice getting closer and closer to the

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
target and it's just between you and your eyes and your shoulder blades.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And your aim and you know it's just between you and the bow and I

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.000
enjoy

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:09.000
that what got you interested in acting and in taking it seriously.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Just loving it.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I did an indie called the Poker House and between the hiatus

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
from my sitcom and I did burning plane and and I did Winter's

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Bone also all night as for the sitcom when I first got on a sitcom like I said I was like

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
I'm good. Lucille Ball I can be on a sitcom for the rest of my life is

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000
great and. Then I fell in love.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
I fell in love with a film I loved.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
It's really so much about just pure acting with me I mean even when I'm when I

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
have time off I just really miss acting so my love for acting turned in to doing

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
more movies and then that turned into a whole business side of things that you know I'm

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
still pretty overwhelmed by figuring out the business of all of that.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
When you were fourteen you went to New York in the hopes of. Doing roles they did when your parents go

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
with you.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
My mom was with me for when we went for spring break that was just going to be like a little

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
trip. That we were going out together and

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
then I ended up getting just go over to Union

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Square and I talked about it every single day talked about acting and.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Every single day when we went back to Kentucky and eventually it was just like I'm leaving and I had saved up

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
enough babysitting money and I was like I'm going. So they tried to find a nice balance

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
between me kind of running away and being completely

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
unsafe having a little bit of supervision so I had a horrible apartment that was completely rat infested.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Thank you New York. Gone. New York and my brother when we was eighteen went with me

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
at first and my parents left us and we're both like we're going to

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
die and then a girl who worked at my mom my parents' children's

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
camp came out watch me for a little bit and I just kind of tradeoff

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
eventually my mom saw how happy I was No I didn't

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
have anxiety anymore I didn't have all of these things that I had when I was in

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
school unhappy. I was so happy that it's I think it was kind of hard for

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
her as a mother to send her back.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Really I think it was also just kind of some sort

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
of maternal instinct that she knew it was the right thing to do which I'm so grateful for to this day.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Well kind of anxiety Did you have.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
I don't know I just like. I was I remember just always feeling

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
exhausted when I was at school and I think about it now

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
wondering what that is I don't know if

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
that's actors. I work with an actor who always says Actors are

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
chameleons you know even if you don't really

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
realize your depth and the kind of everyone the air around which I don't feel that way really about my

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
personality I don't really feel like I change who I am depending on who I'm with

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
but I think you feel a lot of things the only way to do an emotional scene

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
is to feel empathy for your character to think.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
That character is going through and really open up and feel it and now that I know

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
what that is and that's my job and I can channel that I can understand that feeling understand when

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
somebody's telling me a story that's really sad and I feel like I can feel it. I know that that's

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
just it's

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
just normal for me now but as a kid I think by the time we get to lunch I was so

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
exhausted I think I was around a hundred kids feeling every single thing I don't really

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
know I've tried to figure it out maybe just. I mean I guess the simple answer would be social

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
anxiety that kind of fits into you know wanting to go out even now.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Like wanting to yeah oh

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
yeah I don't like being around but I get overwhelmed my favorite thing. I

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.000
much prefer

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
just small circles of people who I actually want to be around to actually want to talk

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
to and being able to just be you know like when you're out and you've got to spend your whole

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
night going thank you oh my God Yeah I think like I look at people. My parents my age

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
now every get married my friends are getting

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
married and I'm like. You want to spend your whole night going thanks thank you thank you for

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
coming thank you so much you know it seems like a nightmare. Seems like award

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
season. So you know being an apartment and age fourteen

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
that had rats. I wouldn't be able to go to sleep at night. How

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
how do you know

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
it's night was horrible that's when they all come out it was you know the bathroom and I

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
just really wanted to that my dad still talks about that he said that's when I knew you were

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
serious that's when I think that that was the turning point for my

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
dad letting me do this as he came and saw all the conditions I was living in you know

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
no water there was no kitchen like a closet with a hot

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
plate and I got to the point where I was literally to sharing food

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
with sake I would to Chinatown that's where I got most everything you're doing where you did it and you know I

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.000
don't really have any

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
money so like a rat eaten my loaf of bread you know before when I first got there I'd be

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
like you and throw the whole loaf of bread away but eventually I was like I could be able for bread. So I started

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
just cutting around the whole

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.000
the. You know it's got a very literally sharing food with a rat.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
So that's what my parents were like Yeah I think

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
she really really wants to do this so do they help you out financially.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Eventually we moved to L.A. we got in our

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
car from Kentucky and we drove to L.A. and that's when I got on the sitcom and they didn't need to support me

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
financially anymore.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
So you mentioned you were discovered in New York in Union Square tells the

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
discovery

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
story. I was watching street dancing and some man named

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Daniel I believe same said I am a model scout can I take

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
your picture and I was like oh well yeah i'll my

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
brothers always talked about all ugly I was that was a shock.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
So I let him take my picture and you know my mom and I didn't know that any of this was creepy we were just from Kentucky.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
It wasn't an end up being creepy but that it could potentially be creepy and so she gave

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
him her number and he called the next day and said oh you know all these modeling agencies want to meet

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
with her and we didn't have anything else to do in New York so we went to the meetings

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
and then somewhere in there I read my first script and I just I

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
knew. Your brother used to tell you you were ugly.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Yeah you know they were brothers they used to call me before you know

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
the boots. Do you know. And yeah but it didn't I didn't care it didn't matter

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
I feel like I have a daughter one day and she has made she's pretty I'm just going to like my didn't matter.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
I never never grew up with that ever. It didn't really matter to me. Yeah I like your

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
answer why does it matter I think it's good you know that matter. Yeah yeah they were

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
I remember one time crying because these girls at school left me out they were every was going to the movies

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
and they did invite me

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
and my mom tried to comfort me and they just they're just jealous of you my

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
brother walks and I

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
goes Don't tell her that they really don't like her because she's I don't ever think you guys don't ever

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
think somebody doesn't like you because you're

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
jealous. My grandmother yesterday. Because they're jealous and I knew I knew

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
that was not it I know it's such a really like an

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
annoying. I don't really know that's a very good lesson to teach somebody I think yeah look at yourself if you

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
feel like somebody doesn't like you think back. There's only you could have done. Could you have offended them. I

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
don't think I should just go oh you're just jealous like why would you raise your

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
kids. Like my mom bless her heart you know this is what moms are for and I'm probably

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
gonna do the same thing when I'm a mother you know when we're watching Joy and then I forgot that the singing part comes on

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.000
and I'm like

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
oh my God Oh my God I put my hand on my hand like I can't watch

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
it and my mom listen because you are the best singer in the entire world you are the greatest singer

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
in the whole world and it's just very So we. But I but

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
that's just not true.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
So you said a couple of things. A couple of big public statements that have actually

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000
made news. I want to ask you about what you said after the Sony hack.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
And when a lot of

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Sony emails. People executives who work at Sony a lot of their e-mails were made public and through

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
those e-mails you learned that men you worked with on movies were getting paid much more for

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
those movies than you were. And you attributed it to a gender double standard and you

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
wrote about

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
it in Lena Dunham's publication Lenny wrote I didn't

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
get mad at Sony I got mad at

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
myself I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early I didn't want to

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
keep fighting for millions of dollars that frankly due to franchises. I don't

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
need parentheses. I told you this wasn't relatable don't hate me and

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
you

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
wrote but if I'm honest with myself I would be lying if I didn't say there was an element of wanting

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
to be liked that influence my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn't

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
want to seem difficult or

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
spoiled and then you say you realize from the hack that quote every man I was working

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
with Definitely didn't worry about

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
being difficult or spoiled. So how did you

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
decide to say that in

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
public

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
I was aware of. Any quality of the you know twenty one

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
percent General pay gap between men and women and

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
and you know when that happened and I and I saw those

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
numbers.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
I really didn't look at that and say something unfair was done to me I think that that's very

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
possible that you know we're talking

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
about this gender bias that

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
also exists in us as women. So

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
we are very possible as individuals are doing this to

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
ourselves that we have.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
A historical global reputation

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
that isn't being a baller or a bad ass or being

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
aggressive you know that's not an

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
attractive to do those things but more than that you know but that was really the pay gap the

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
pay gap and why I wanted to discuss it was because I was like

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
if I'm having these feelings and I it's my own kind

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
of mentality that's getting in my own way and

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
the statistics are an arguable. Maybe I'm not the only woman

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
who feels this

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
way and I figured if I had a voice I should use it in case there are

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
other women out there that that are not getting paid or not asking for

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
money the way that they should be because of

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
the same kind of relatable feelings that I was having so did that

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.000
affect your

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
ability to equalize the playing field financially.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
I'm still working on it you know I wish that I could say I wrote it and then and then boom the problem was

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
fixed but that's just not true I was writing about a very

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
true problem that I have you know I'm still struggling with

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
it. How did you start thinking this way did you always think this way.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Is this kind of thing came recently to you.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.000
I

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
think I've always been outspoken and opinionated.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
But growing up and learning

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
more I'm talking specifically about just thinking in terms of gender about what gender equality

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
gender is now and it was reset was getting and it was getting into

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
the world of commerce it was getting and you know having a.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Having a

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
power on that and

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000
not wanting to use it or not wanting to recognize it because I always I just want to

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
be likeable I just wanna be likable and then realizing you just get screwed

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
over so I think it just came developed over time

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
from from working because I I was I was saying yes to

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
these things and doing overtime for free and all this stuff because I wanted to be like

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
just seemed ridiculous and I didn't meet one actor who would do the same I don't mean one male actor who did the

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
same thing.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
After your i Cloud account was hacked and naked pictures of you were posted.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
You called it a sexual violation and you said anybody who looked

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
at those pictures you're perpetuating a sexual offense. You should cower

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:02.000
with

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
shame you were quoted as saying that in Vanity Fair and that's a very strong thing to

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
say and I think it's very interesting that instead of you know be being

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
embarrassed or anything that these pictures were

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
shown you expressed anger not only at

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
whoever hacked and posted these but anybody who is just going

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
to look at it thinking well it's posted everybody else is looking so why can't you.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
You said they were guilty

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
too. Can you talk about deciding how to frame your feelings

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
about the hack of your photos.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
I wasn't the first victim of that you know there have been hacks like that going

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
on for years and I have never once ever looked at a

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
photo of a naked person's body without their permission. I think that that's

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
a disgusting thing to do. It's unthinkable I would never do those

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
acts have happened for years

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
and. I would feel so creepy looking

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
at someone's naked body without their

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
permission and you know when it happened to me I wasn't embarrassed.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
I was it was I was in a long distance relationship for four and a half

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
years and even if I wasn't in a long distance relationship it wouldn't matter it was my body with

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
my private email and I had the freedom to do what I wanted and

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
I was I was I was and I

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
was angry hackers are hackers. And hackers are gross

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
disgusting perverts and what they did was wrong

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
and that goes without saying

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
but the idea that.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
It's when something becomes popular all of a sudden it's now

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
OK it's just shocking how it's not personal to people anymore. That's

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
why people can say whatever they want to me and in the news or are they can hear me

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
say one thing about me not liking popcorn and then judge my entire personality it's like assoon as your celebrity.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
It's so impersonal. But those pictures were incredibly personal to me and my naked body.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
I haven't shown on camera I haven't done anything you know by

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
choice of my body and I

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:23.000
felt angry at websites. Re posting them.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
And I can't really describe to you the feeling

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
that took a very long time to go away wondering at any point. Who's just passing my

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
body around has got a picture of my body on their phone and is at a barbecue and looking at them

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
or who's It's it was an unshakable really really

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
awful feeling that after it healed a little bit made me

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
incredibly angry.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
So you're involved with two projects now that I'm very excited about One is you working on a project

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
with Amy Schumer and the others. You're going to play Lindsay a

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Dario the Great. New York Times were Fatah. For who wrote a

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
terrific memoir about her experiences in war

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
zones. So tell us a little bit

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
about one of those projects before we wrap

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
up. I have to choose.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Well why don't we go with the Amy Schumer because I think that's more of

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
a wild card I think because I'm more involved in that one

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000
so I have no idea what that project is.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Amy Schumer and Jim Jim are sister and I finished the script about

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
a week ago. It's a

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
comedy and we really really love it it's just

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
now starting to get passed around are they going to make it you know Amy I've never seen the sight of

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
her before this character that she's going to be playing nobody seen the care and the character that I'm going to be

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
playing as a new side of

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
me and it was incredibly fun to develop and

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
the two of them being sisters Kaminey. That get along like I said things I've never

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
seen before and being and incredible writers has

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
brought such a harmonious unbelievable wonderful

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
relationship to the screen. You know that helped us develop these characters so kind of quickly

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
and thoroughly. I'm really excited about

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
that morning if it's particularly fulfilling for you

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
to work with Amy and Kim Schumer because so much of

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
their writing has a kind of agenda or awareness to

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
it a kind of feminist and these are things that obviously rising to the surface

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:37.000
in

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
your concerns about you know pay equality about nude

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
photos about

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
how women are perceived Of course you're doing it as a

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
comedy and not as like a speech.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Yeah you know you and I both

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
of our boys. You mean they're both share in the cam and I

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
all kind of share

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
similar. Politics

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
and you know and they're very early on there isn't a smartest people I've ever met in

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
my entire life Amy so incredibly observant people I mean even my dog

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
she can imitate my dog perfectly. She's a very brilliant

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
woman and yeah and we we did we did it we didn't the comedy

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
it's not very broad.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
It's it's got some feeling in

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
it when I look forward to seeing it. Thank you so much for talking with us

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000

final installment of The Hunger Games. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR.

What is it to be human.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
What is it to be alive.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
The new movie anomalies about loneliness and disconnection is told through

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
stop motion animation using puppets and miniature

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
sets but it looks oddly authentic. I'll talk with the film's directors Charlie Kaufman
